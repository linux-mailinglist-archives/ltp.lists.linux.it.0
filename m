Interesting, thanks.

Indeed I have no idea what running LTP on networked FS (including Ceph)
produces.

I suppose CephFS would also, but we make no attempt to support that in
LTP.

Only the complication of adding a special approach for BTRFS. If we find
more FS with this issue, then we may have to add code for them also.

I would accept this approach though, because it is more direct and it's
not clear that scanning mountinfo will work either.

The major and minor are never correct in mountinfo, but the device path
is correct most of the time. This can be used to get the real major and
minor if necessary or get the sector size as in this case.

To verify that it works, you can run the test with TMPDIR set to a path
on BTRFS. For e.g. using a loop device with BTRFS.

$ cd /tmp
$ fallocate -l 300MiB btrfs.img
$ losetup -f btrfs.img
$ mkfs.btrfs /dev/loop0
$ mkdir btrfs
$ mount -t btrfs /dev/loop0 btrfs
$ export TMPDIR=/tmp/btrfs
$ ioctl_loop05
