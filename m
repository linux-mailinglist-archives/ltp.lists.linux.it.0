All right.

Let's see which flag combinations we have in the relevant tests in fanotify14:

FAN_REPORT_DFID_FID,
FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME,
FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME_TARGET,

That's all.

Support for FAN_REPORT_FID is a requirement for the entire test.

FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID depends on all the rest of the flags
and support for it is already checked explicitly to skip test cases.

FAN_REPORT_NAME depends on FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID.

So effectively fanotify_get_supported_init_flags() only checks
FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID separately from the combination
FAN_REPORT_DFID_FID.

fanotify16, which tests *legal* combinations of these flags
already checks the separate flag FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID
so fanotify test cases with FAN_REPORT_DFID_FID would
fail if a kernel that supports FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID does not
support the combination FAN_REPORT_DFID_FID.

Bottom line:
fanotify_get_supported_init_flags() did not add any test coverage.

This is why it is a slippery slope to suggest fixes without
proving that there is a bug.

Thanks,
Amir.
