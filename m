Maybe it's not testing what was orginally intended, but filling the FS
with all zero's is an important corner case. We don't want to remove
that coverage. We at least want to check that the kernel doesn't
crash.

So it is testing deduplication of non-zero pages. In general these are
testing a degenerate case.
