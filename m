Hi!

And this is something that I think is a suboptimal solution. If the run
crashes in the middle you can't easily continue with the rest of the
tests after the system under test has been rebooted. So the desing
decision for kirk was that the complete state of the testsuite execution
is being kept on the machine that drives the testing.

I did a talk at SUSE Labs conference when I tried to explain when we are
heading and it was recorded, unfortunately it wasn't uploaded to youtube
yet, I will post the link here once it's there.

The bottom line question is how much code from us can be reused in your
environment and this is something we have to figure out.

We decided to go for JSON format for generic the test results for kirk.

However given that we store the results in python data structures
internally, it's easy to write an exporter for a format you want and
produce that directly. We can add CSV exporter for spreadsheets in 100
lines of python.

The JSON exported looks like this:

https://github.com/linux-test-project/kirk/blob/master/libkirk/export.py

The second one is preferable.

That is actually the end goal. The ltx is designed to marshal messages
over a byte oriented connection, the supported commands at the moment
can execute binaries, transfer files, etc. We intend to use it over
virtio and physical serial ports as well. So the idea is that once ltx
is started on the system uder test kirk connect to that instance to
drive the testing. It's not production ready yet, and that is something
that I have on my TODO.

That's what I'm hoping to avoid to keep things in a simple modules, but
I guess that we will run into a lot of implementation details that will
make things hard or even impossible...
