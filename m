That is really strange, there are practically no dependencies for the
metadata extractor. All that you have to have is a C compiler and libc.

You should have reported that on the list. It's going to be really
cornerstone of the way how tests are executed so the build should get
fixed anyways.

I guess that we can add a flag that disables the metadata extraction
step, with a big red warning that describes the consequencies of the
choice.
