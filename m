Whatever tree-sitter produces most naturally and requires the least
amount of massaging.

As discussed in IRC, I prefer the route of trying either Sparse or
Tree-sitter first to produce the metadata. However please go ahead and
make the decision. After all once we have better automation it will
reduce the burden on reviewers.
