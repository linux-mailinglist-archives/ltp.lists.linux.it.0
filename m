OK, so to summarise niether strategy works when the FS is BTRFS and init
has not done something about /dev/root.

I suppose part of the problem is BTRFS can span multiple devices
(IIUC). So there is no definite single backing device.

The command "btrfs devices stat <path>", uses the BTRFS_IOC_DEV_INFO
ioctl to get backing device paths.

Well it allows the test to work on BTRFS in most situations. Possibly if
we find that the FS is BTRFS, the device is /dev/root and it doesn't
exist. Then we should call tst_brk(TCONF...

AFAICT what the test actually wants is the block device sector size
(BLKSSZGET). Possibly this can be retrieved with the BTRFS_IOC_FS_INFO
ioctl.

The final option would be to try using some other BTRFS specific ioctl
to get the backing device(s). If there is more than one then just return
the first. That's probably not worth the effort for the current test,
but I think it is quite likely this issue will arise again. io_control01
has a similar requirement.
