I do not think that listing flags that are tested is pointless, at least
this is supposed to be documentation for the test that is shown on a web
page, it should be a bit more verbose than the single sentence you wrote
there.

I guess that MS_NOSYMFOLLOW should be easy enough, we just need to
create a symlink to a file and then attempt to open it. We shouldn't end
up with a fd to the symlinked file in that case.

MS_LAZYTIME would be again complicated since that is about deffering
timestamps in memory so it would be similar to MS_SYNCHRONOUS in the
terms of complexity.

I would follow the usuall, don't add anything that is not used.
