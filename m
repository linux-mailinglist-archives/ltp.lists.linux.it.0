AFAICT fatal signals are special which means a reschedule event is sent
immediately on kill. However I guess the IPI doesn't get delivered to
another CPU synchronously, not to mention that preemption might be
disabled, so we don't know what state everything is in by the time
kill() returns.

I guess also some long running kernel code will continue to run after it
has received kill and been rescheduled. So wait could block for a longer
period. In this case though we don't need to worry about the process we
are trying to kill returning to userland.

Regardless of whether all that is correct we can mark the worker as
failed, call kill then call waitpid with WNOHANG. Then either restart it
or return to the main loop. If we didn't restart it, the next time we
encounter that worker we can call waitpid again. After some number of
failures we can abandon waiting on it and create a new process.
