No, we don't have such a thing now, and we don't really track that
information in the kernel.

We do have a sb->s_time_gran field which is in units of nanoseconds, but
that really is more about the granularity that the filesystem itself can
store on disk. It doesn't tell you whether the kernel decided to put a
coarse or fine grained timestamp in there.

Thanks, and yes. This should be safe to apply now even if the kernel
patch series never goes in.
