I have been involved in the kernel nommu space for 20 years, and sure, there is
some of that. But mostly spending some time and effort to get involved pays off.
I have seen potential contributors show up with some arrogant attitudes too,
so it cuts both ways here.

The m68k community I have been part of has been nothing but welcoming. The mm
people have tried hard to keep nommu support up-to-date where almost none of them
actually have a vested interest in doing so.

What I have seen is that many companies working in this space just don't want
to spend the time and effort to go mainline. That is a business decision they
make, and that is fine. Heck my work in actual mainline has never really been
paid for by any company and I have sunk a _lot_ of time into it. (Full disclosure
I did get paid to work on early porting and support - just not geting it into
mainline and maintain it there).

Any company/person who follows the route of not working with the linux kernel
community to get their work included is going to inevitably get stuck on older
versions of everything.

I regularly test nommu configurations (as in every kernel rc and release) on m68k
and at least every release on other architectures like arm(*) and recently on
riscv as well.

(*) somewhat annoyingly needing a minor patch to run the versatile qemu platform
     I like to test with. But hey, that is on me :-)

Greg
