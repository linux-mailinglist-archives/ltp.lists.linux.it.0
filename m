+Ground Rules
+============
+
+Do not work around kernel bugs
+------------------------------
+
+We have decided what we will not work around bugs in upstream LTP sources. If a
+test fails on your system for a good reason, e.g. patch wasn't backported and
+the bug is present, work around for this will not be accepted upstream. The
+main reason for this decision is that this masks the failure for everyone else.
+
+
+Do not synchronize by sleep
+---------------------------
+
+Why is sleep in tests bad then?
+```````````````````````````````
+
+The first problem is that it may and will introduce very rare test failures,
+that means somebody has to spend time looking into these, which is a wasted
+effort. Also I'm pretty sure that nobody likes tests that will fail rarely for
+no good reason. Even more so you cannot run such tests with a background load
+to ensure that everything works correctly on a bussy system, because that will
+increase the likehood of a failure.
+
+The second problem is that this wastes resources and slowns down a test run. If
+you think that adding a sleep to a test is not a big deal, let me put things
+into a perspective. There is about 1600 syscall tests in Linux Test Project
+(LTP), if 7.5% of them would sleep just for one second, we would end up with
+two minutes of wasted time per testrun. In practice most of the test I've seen
+waited for much longer just to be sure that things will works even on slower
+hardware. With sleeps between 2 and 5 seconds that puts us somewhere between 4
+and 10 minutes which is between 13% and 33% of the syscall runtime on my dated
+thinkpad, where the run finishes in a bit less than half an hour. It's even
+worse on newer hardware, because this slowdown will not change no matter how
+fast your machine is, which is maybe the reason why this was acceptable twenty
+years ago but it's not now.
+
+
+What to do instead?
+```````````````````
+
+Use proper synchronization.
+
+There are different problems and different solutions.
+
+Most often tests needs to synchronize between child and parent proces.
+
+The easiest case is that parent needs to wait for a child to finish, that can
+be fixed just be adding a waitpid() in the parent which ensures that child is
+finished before parent runs.
+
+Commonly child has to execute certain piece of code before parent can continue.
+For that LTP library implements checkpoints with simple wait and wake functions
+based on futexes on a piece of shared memory set up by the test library.
+
+Another common case is where child must sleep in a syscall before parent can
+continue, for which we have a helper that polls /proc/$PID/stat.
+
+Less often tests needs to wait for an action that is done asynchronously, or a
+kernel resource deallocation is deffered to a later time. In such cases the
+best we can do is to poll. In LTP we ended up with a macro that polls by
+calling a piece of code in a loop with exponentially increasing sleeps between
+retries until it succeeeds. Which means that instead of sleeping for a maximal
+time event can possibly take the sleep is capped by twice of the optimal
+sleeping time while we avoid polling too aggressively.
