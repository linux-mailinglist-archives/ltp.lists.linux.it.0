Hi Martin,

> The test schedules multiple async writes into a file and then hopes that
> at least one will block long enough that aio_cancel() will fail to cancel
> it. Use a socket pair instead of a file to force async writes to block
> indefinitely. Then wait for one of the writes to actually block on full
> socket buffer. This fixes a race condition where aio_cancel() could be
> called while no write is actually in progress (before the first write,
> after the last one or between two writes) and the test would fail.

> Also rewrite result checks to verify that all writes before the blocked
> one actually completed and all writes after the blocked one were cancelled.

> Add cleanup helper function that will flush socket buffers, free allocated
> memory and close the sockets. Also make setup and cleanup simpler
> by statically allocating the aiocb structure array.

+1, thank you. Similar way as your fix for aio_cancel_7-1 in 220f579cd6.
I wonder if some other needs to be fixed this way.

We now use socket. Maybe update docs?

Code itself LGTM.
