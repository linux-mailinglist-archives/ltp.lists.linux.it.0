This may well be a subject on which reasonable people can disagree.
I'm going to lay out what I believe the positions of the various
parties are here, and plese feel free to speak up if you feel I'm
mischaracterising anyone.

The LTP people see it as their mandate to test all syscalls.  They focus
on getting the correct error code, checking corner cases of the API, etc.

The xfstests people see it as their mandate to test filesystems.
They focus on testing the corner cases of the filesystem.

These are quite different things, and I'm not sure that forcing them
together or moving test-cases from one test-suite to the other makes
sense.  I think it's reasonable to have two separate test suites for you
(and the various bots) to run, even though it's slightly more work.

At the end of the day, I don't much care, it doesn't significantly affect
my life.  If I could see a clear advantage to converting one to the other,
I'd be all for it, but I don't see a compelling reason to put much work
in here.
