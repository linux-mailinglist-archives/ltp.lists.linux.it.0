OK, your system is Alpine (it can shorten our discussion next time if you report
you have problems on musl - i.e. which kernel and libc + versions you use).

Well, we should first check if this is not a bug in musl or Alpine before
requiring root.

It'd be interesting to know whether tools/testing/selftests/vm/memfd_secret.c
and tools/testing/selftests/x86/test_vsyscall.c also require root.

Before I wrote to musl ML and/or ptrace maintainer, anybody knows why
__NR_process_vm_readv requires root? Looking at kernel mm/process_vm_access.c,
process_vm_rw() calls process_vm_rw_core(), where:

	mm = mm_access(task, PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS);
	if (!mm || IS_ERR(mm)) {
		rc = IS_ERR(mm) ? PTR_ERR(mm) : -ESRCH;
		/*
		 * Explicitly map EACCES to EPERM as EPERM is a more
		 * appropriate error code for process_vw_readv/writev
		 */
		if (rc == -EACCES)
			rc = -EPERM;
		goto put_task_struct;
	}

=> kernel/fork.c

struct mm_struct *mm_access(struct task_struct *task, unsigned int mode)
{
	...
	mm = get_task_mm(task);
	if (mm && mm != current->mm &&
			!ptrace_may_access(task, mode)) {
		mmput(mm);
		mm = ERR_PTR(-EACCES);
	}

=> kernel/ptrace.c

/* Returns 0 on success, -errno on denial. */
static int __ptrace_may_access(struct task_struct *task, unsigned int mode)
{
	const struct cred *cred = current_cred(), *tcred;
	struct mm_struct *mm;
	kuid_t caller_uid;
	kgid_t caller_gid;

	if (!(mode & PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS) == !(mode & PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS)) {
		WARN(1, "denying ptrace access check without PTRACE_MODE_*CREDS\n");
		return -EPERM;
	}

	...
	rcu_read_unlock();
	return -EPERM;
ok:
	...

Failing LTP code:
	TEST(tst_syscall(__NR_process_vm_readv, pid_alloc, &local, 1UL, &remote,
					 1UL, 0UL));

	if (TST_RET != length)
		tst_brk(TBROK, "process_vm_readv: %s", tst_strerrno(-TST_RET));
