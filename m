This may actually work, since we are trying to make kirk flexible enough
to run other testsuites, I think that we already run subset of selftest
with kirk in our environment.

I'm afraid that's not a good solution either. The end goal for kirk is
to have a small binary locked in RAM and with realtime priority to
execute tests and send back logs, in case of qemu over virtio, to the
kirk. That is to make sure that logs are collected properly even when
kernel is out of memory and in a similar situations.

If you run kirk on the VM, reporting is not going to be reliable.

My initial idea was to build the new generation testrunner as a set of
building blocks, that could be reused separately, but the current desing
does not make it easy.

We do have the ltx binary, which is the small dispatcher supposed to run
on the VM. And in an ideal world we would have a python library that
talks to it on the other end, as a part of kirk, that could be reused
separately. And the same for building lists of test to execute, ideally
we would have a python library that would export a simple interface so
that everyone could integrate the blocks that they really need into
their solution.
