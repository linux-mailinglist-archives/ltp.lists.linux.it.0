The whole point why we are going in circles around how to structure this
piece of code is code readibility. Source code is more often read than
written, which means that it's more important to invest into writing
code that is easily understandable since that will save effort in the
long term. That is true especially for kernel tests, where there is
enough complexity in the kernel itself and writing tests that are not
easy to understand does actually harm.

There is a key difference between tst_res() defined to tst_res_() that
adds a few parameters and macros that change the codeflow. If there are
macros that change code flow, and perhaps checkpatch is right here that
it's wiser to avoid them at all, they should at least scream in upper
case letters that this is not a regular function.

This all boils down to a principle of a least surprise.

Perhaps the best solution would be to get back to a drawing board and
figure out how to better structure the test so that the code flow is
easier to follow.

Again, let's not work around the tooling we have, the tooling is
supposed to help, once you start bending the code so that the tooling is
happy you are on a wrong path.
