Nice!  IMA code paths are different on filesystems with/without
i_version support.   With the proposed i_version kernel
changes, ima_measurement.sh test2 is really important.

On filesystems without i_version support, after a file has been opened
for write, on fput IMA assumes the file has been modified.  On next
access, the file is re-verified/re-measured.

I'm not sure if ima_measurement.sh test2, which is limited to
filesystems with i_version support, should be extended or a new test
defined to detect whether a file is properly re-measured after it has
been modified on all filesystems, even those without i_version support.

Yes, there shouldn't be a new measurement.

Sounds good.
