> -# Maintainer Patch Review Checklist
> +# Patch Review
> +
> +Anyone can and should review patches. It's the only way to get good at
> +patch review and for the project to scale.
> +
> +## Goals of patch review
> +
> +1. Prevent false positive test results
> +2. Prevent false negative test results
> +3. Keep the code as simple as possible, but no simpler
> +
> +## How to find clear errors
> +
> +A clear error is one where there is unlikely to be any argument if you
> +provide evidence of it. Evidence being an error trace or logical proof
> +that an error will occur in a common situation.
> +
> +The following are examples and may not be appropriate for all tests.
> +
> +* Merge the patch. It should apply cleanly to master.
> +* Compile the patch with default and non-default configurations.
> +  - Use sanitizers e.g. undefined behaviour, address.
> +  - Compile on non-x86
> +  - Compile on x86 with -m32
> +* Use `make check`
> +* Run effected tests in a VM
> +  - Use single vCPU
> +  - Use many vCPUs and enable NUMA
> +  - Restrict RAM to < 1GB.
> +* Run effected tests on an embedded device
> +* Run effected tests on non-x86 machine in general
> +* Run reproducers on a kernel where the bug is present
> +* Run tests with "-i0"
> +* Compare usage of system calls with man page descriptions
> +* Compare usage of system calls with kernel code
> +* Search the LTP library for existing helper functions
> +
> +## How to find subtle errors
> +
> +A subtle error is one where you can expect some argument because you
> +do not have clear evidence of an error. It is best to state these as
> +questions and not make assertions if possible.
> +
> +Although if it is a matter of style or "taste" then senior maintainers
> +can assert what is correct to avoid bike shedding.
> +
> +* Ask what happens if there is an error, could it be debugged just
> +  with the test output?
> +* Are we testing undefined behavior?
> +  - Could future kernel behaviour change without "breaking userland"?
> +  - Does the kernel behave differently depending on hardware?
> +  - Does it behave differently depending kernel on configuration?
> +  - Does it behave differently depending on the compiler?
  - Does it behave differently when order of checks on syscall
    parameters change in kernel?

We used to have quite some tests that passed two or more invalid
parameters to a sysycall expecting one of them would be checked first...

> +* Will it scale to tiny and huge systems?
> +  - What happens if there are 100+ CPUs?
> +  - What happens if each CPU core is very slow?
> +  - What happens if there are 2TB or RAM?
> +* Are we repeating a pattern that can be turned into a library function?
> +* Is a single test trying to do too much?
> +* Could multiple similar tests be merged?
> +* Race conditions
> +  - What happens if a process gets preempted?
> +  - Could checkpoints or fuzzsync by used instead?
> +  - Note, usually you can insert a sleep to prove a race condition
> +    exists however finding them is hard
> +* Is there a simpler way to achieve the same kernel coverage?
> +
> +## How to get patches merged
> +
> +Once you think a patch is good enough you should add your Reviewed-by
> +and/or Tested-by tags. This means you will get some credit for getting
> +the patch merged. Also some blame if there are problems.
> +
> +If you ran the test you can add the Tested-by tag. If you read the
> +code or used static analysis tools on it, you can add the Reviewed-by
> +tag.
> +
> +In addition you can expect others to review your patches and add their
> +tags. This will speed up the process of getting your patches merged.
> +
> +## Maintainers Checklist

Looks very nice, thanks for writing this out.
