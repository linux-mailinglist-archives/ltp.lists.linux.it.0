That sounds way to complicated, unfortunately reality is often
complicated and cannot be overly simplified.

So I would go with the simple paraphrase to Einstein, that is short and
to the point.

Tested-by: means that someone actually tried the test and that it did
what it was supposed to do. This has obvious meaning for reproducers,
and yes for a reproducer you can add both tags and both are meaningful.

For regular tests Tested-by does not have that much value I guess.
