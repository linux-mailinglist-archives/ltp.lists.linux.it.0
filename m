Hi Andrea,

I guess we probably don't care about MIPS, although it's still supported by
kernel.

> At the same time, "restart_syscall" is supposed to be used for internal
> usage only.

We probably don't bother about this one. But again, this warning "There is no
glibc wrapper for this system call, because it is intended for use only by the
kernel and should never be called by applications." does not automatically mean
we should not test it. We don't test just glibc, but also kernel internals,
right? The note is written this way, because man pages aren't meant to be for
LTP developers but for user space application developers.

Kind regards,
Petr
