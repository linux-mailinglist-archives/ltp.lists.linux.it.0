OK, you're missing that kernel version. OTOH things get sometimes backported,
thus it's not error prone (if we forget to leave that flag after kernel being
released).

Also version is hard to say if you use maintainer tree (which applies patches on
previous rc1 than what is being in Linus tree). Thus maintainer's tree would be
left, also IMHO next tree has no specific version in uname, thus we'd only
support rc from Linus' tree.

But anyway, if all agree that this is better than both solutions Richie
implemented I'd try to find time to implement it so that we have finally a
solution.

Correct. At this stage IMHO we can dare to merge it.

Kind regards,
Petr
