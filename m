Hi Andrea,

once more, now Cc the list. I'm sorry for the noise.

Generally LGTM, notes below.

IMHO this TODO page is for new LTP developers to see ideas what to work on,
right?  Thinking about it twice, IMHO this should be in doc/developers/.
At least normal LTP users (testers) don't bother what we want to develop.

IMHO this TODO page is for new LTP developers to see ideas what to work on,
right? Wouldn't be more useful to put it to the page which people using LTP will
be reading? Maybe one of these:

https://linux-test-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/quick_start.html
https://linux-test-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/setup_tests.html

I quite like your first version which showed number of lines. But if you want to
just list of the old API tests, why not use git grep -l ?

git --no-pager grep -l 'include "test\.h"' testcases/

That reminds me Cyril's saying "it's easy to write portable shell *interpreter*

That's tst_run_shell. Could you please use link to the source?

:master:`testcases/lib/tst_run_shell.c`

> +:doc:`LTP API <../developers/api_c_tests>`.
For shell loader are useful only struct tst_test tags in JSON comments.
Maybe point directly to struct tst_test?

Maybe the most descriptive are tests in testcases/lib/tests/.

:master:`testcases/lib/tst_run_shell.c` features. Please take a look at the
:ref:`struct tst_test` and examples in :master:`testcases/lib/tests/`.

(NOTE: besides testcases/lib/tst_run_shell.c there is also
testcases/lib/tst_run.sh and testcases/lib/tst_env.sh but we can ignore it in
this short info.  If we really convert most of the shell tests to shell runner,
we should write doc in a separate page. In that case we could leave
doc/old/Shell-Test-API.asciidoc unconverted).

Kind regards,
Petr
