In commmit 6df425bb7040 ("fanotify10: Calling drop_cache twice to ensure
the inode is evicted"), the number of drop_cache operations was increased
to two in order to prevent inodes from being left uncleared due to inodes
and dentries being on different NUMA nodes, which would cause the testcase
to fail.

However, during our local testing, I found that this testcase still
occasionally fails:

fanotify10.c:771: TINFO: Test #27: don't ignore fs events created inside a parent with evicted ignore mark
fanotify10.c:510: TPASS: Found 0 ignore marks which is in expected range 0-0

fanotify10.c:841: TPASS: group 1 (8) got 16 events: mask 20 pid=22962
fanotify10.c:841: TPASS: group 2 (8) got 16 events: mask 20 pid=22962
fanotify10.c:836: TFAIL: group 0 (4) with FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM got unexpected number of events (15 != 16)
fanotify10.c:836: TFAIL: group 1 (4) with FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM got unexpected number of events (15 != 16)
fanotify10.c:836: TFAIL: group 2 (4) with FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM got unexpected number of events (15 != 16)
......

In this testcase(Test #27), ignore_path is "fs_mnt/testdir", and event_path
is "fs_mnt/testdir/testfile". The purpose of ignore_path is to verify that
the ignore_mark does not pin the corresponding inode. If any inodes remain
after drop_cache, the test case will fail. Here, the ignore_path is located
in a two-level directory structure, and two drop_cache operations might
still not be enough.

Consider the scenario where the parent inode is on NUMA0, the parent dentry
is on NUMA1, the child inode is on NUMA2, and the child dentry is on NUMA3.
After the first drop_cache, the child dentry is cleared, its inode and
parent dentry are placed in the *corresponding* lru link list; after the
second drop_cache, the parent dentry and the child inode are cleared; only
after the third drop_cache would the parent inode be fully released. The
corresponding kernel flow is as follows:

drop_caches_sysctl_handler
  drop_slab
    // Traverse NUMA in order.
    drop_slab_node
    ...
      // Free dentry, child dentry pin parent dentry and its inode.
      prune_dcache_sb
      ...
        dentry_unlink_inode
        ...
          // Place the inode into its corresponding NUMA lru link list.
          list_lru_add
      /*
       * Free inode. If the NUMA where the inode resides is different from
       * its dentry, the inode may not be released this time.
       */
      prune_icache_sb

			drop_cache1	drop_cache2	drop_cache3
NUMA0: parent inode	exist		exist		free
NUMA1: parent dentry	exist		free		free
NUMA2: child inode	exist		free		free
NUMA3: child dentry	free		free		free

Due to the release of the dependency chain, the drop_cache cleanup also
takes several times. Therefore, to be safe, three drop_cache operations are
needed to handle the two-level directory structure.
