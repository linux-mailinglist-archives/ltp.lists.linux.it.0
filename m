Thanks for a hint, actions/checkout [1] looks useful.

@Cyril We currently have github pages uploaded within separate repository [2],
we'd need to convert it to Publishing with a custom GitHub Actions workflow [3].
That would include to migrate the necessary content (index.html and assets
directory) to ltp repository (put into new web directory) and create new GitHub
Actions workflow (examples [4] [5]).

This would help that 1) we'd not need Personal Access Token (everything is in
single repository) 2) only a real sources would be stored in git, not generated
files. It's not a high priority for me, but I'm willing to implement everything,
if I got ack from you.

FYI I find hint to use workflow_dispatch [6], but doc states [7] that for
triggering a workflow from a workflow (our case) secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN (IMHO
within repository) cannot be used. Instead, personal access token must be set
(in one of the developers account), store it in your repo or orgs secrets and
reference that instead. i.e. the same approach I already implemented.  Maybe
this reversed approach would be cleaner, but as they both require PATH, from the
security point they are the same.

=> Using actions/checkout is better solution for us anyway. But it's good to
know, that any actions between repos requires Personal access token (fortunately
we will never need to some triggering between subprojects). I'm not sure gitlab
would be easier on this, but we're not going to migrate to gitlab anyway.

Kind regards,
Petr
