However that is still redundant information, right?

The meaning of "FAIL: line xyz" and "FAIL: failure line xyz" is the
same, the second one is just longer. Let's keep the messages short
and to the point.

Sounds good.

The reason why I do not like the longjmp() is that it obscures the code
flow. If we have explicit if () and break; it's clear what is happening.
With setjmp() you have to search the code for corresponding longjmp()
calls. It's not that bad in this case but I would still stick to
avoiding longjmp() unless really necessary.

I guess that we can also put the map() (touch()) test_counters() unamp()
sequence to a do_test() fuction then call it from the for() loop in
run_test(). That would make the code a bit cleaner.
