Thanks for report! I agree returning EROFS from the mount although
'aborting' succeeded is confusing and is mostly an unintended side effect
that after aborting the fs further changes to mount state are forbidden but
the testcase additionally wants to remount the fs read-only.

I don't think forcibly setting SB_RDONLY in this case is good because it
would still bypass all VFS checks for read-only remount and thus possibly
causing undesirable surprises (similar to those d3476f3dad4a ("ext4: don't
set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errors") tried to fix). At this point I'm
undecided whether __ext4_remount() should just return success after
aborting the filesystem, ignoring all other mount options, or whether we
should follow more the old behavior where we still reflect other mount
options (mostly resulting in cleanup of lazy itable initialization thread,
mmpd thread and similar).  I'm more leaning towards option 1) but I could
be convinced otherwise. Ted, what do you think?
