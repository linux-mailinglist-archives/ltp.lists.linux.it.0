Between the builtin and arch specific policies, most of the rules are already
defined.  The exception is measuring the boot command line.  Perhaps we should
update the arch specific policy to include it with the other kexec rules.

The arch specific policy may include the rule that requires the IMA policy to be
signed.

How about first checking if the rule exists when there is a builtin or
equivalent custom policy loaded, before loading the example test policy?

Ok.  Remember even with "ima_policy=tcb" specified on the boot command line, the
results will differ depending on whether the arch specific policy is loaded.

Good.  The first patch introduces the equivalent custom policy to
"ima_policy=tcb".  By "load a custom policy" are you referring to this policy or
a specific policy test rule?

Probably the latter option of converting from TBROK/TFAIL to TCONF is
preferable.  Why fail a test without knowing it will fail.

There are two main problems:
- Not being able to read the policy.
- Only being able to load a signed policy.

I think between your above ordering and a new test to see if the policy needs to
be signed, it's the best we can do for now.

As mentioned in my 2/8 response, a new package containing pre-defined custom
policies that are signed by the distro would resolve the latter problem.


Thanks,

Mimi
