struct tst_cgroup_opts and tst_cgroup_print_config could be
extended. These are presently only used for debugging IIRC.

BTW don't worry about the purity of API too much or how it's implemented
to begin with. The current API is nice, but that is only after a lengthy
review process.

Perhaps, but if a test dies then we usually assume a kernel bug happened
and abort. In the future we want tests to be able to restart the system,
but we don't have concrete information about such scenarios.

We have to save the PID (or some kind of test ID) that is used to
identify the CGroup. So may as well save what CGroups we created as
well.

Yeah, I would prefer C in general. I'm not sure what is the path of
least resistance though.
