That patch looks like a mistake.  The author noticed that the rpc stats
were not "namespacified" and instead of reporting the bug (and surely
the whole point of a test suite is to report bugs), they made a change
that seems completely unnecessary which had the effect of entrenching
the bug.  Unfortunately the commit message only says why it is same to
make the change, not why it us useful.

Stats should always be visible in the relevant namespace.  server stats
should be visible in the name space where the server runs.  client stats
should be visible in the namespace where the filesystem is mounted.
This has always been true (as long as we have had stats) and if it ever
stops being true, that is a bug.
I think the test suite should test for precisely this case.  Testing if
the stats are visible from a different namespace is not likely to be an
interesting test - unless you want to guard against the possibility that
we will one day accidentally de-namespaceify the stats (stranger things
have happened).
