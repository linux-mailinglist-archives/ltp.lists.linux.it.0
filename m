+1. We would need at least some comment. If there are more things to say, it
might be useful to have a wiki page about container based testing (if you have
time and energy to write it).

Sure, no problem. The real work is to identify these runtime dependencies.
I mean not libraries without development headers (headers does not take that
much size, thus I would not bother), but various other tools (e.g. ip,
ping, mkfs.*, useradd, quotacheck, e4crypt, exportfs, modprobe, rmmod, ...) Some
of them are installed on normal distro, but not all; for sure most of them
aren't installed in the default container.

I'm not sure if that was a correct decision. Sure, it might be easier to
maintain scripts like this in the projects kirk runs (e.g. LTP, Kselftest),
but OTOH I see a benefit in having unified interface for all project
(or at least run these upstreamed scripts in kirk in unified way).

Kind regards,
