That's what I'm expecting there as well.

There is a fallback to a well-known location that can be overrided with
an environment varible. This is not well designed at this point, I just
wrote a minimal amount of code for the prototype to run.

No idea, so far my patchset just puts it into $LTPROOT, but I guess that
/usr/test/ would be much better place. Do we have a proposal for the
/usr/test/ hierarchy somewhere?

Currently it's used by the LTP test library, so it's executed by the
test binary before it forks a child that actually runs the test.

In the future it could be executed by the test driver (e.g. replacement
for ltp-pan I'm working on), which could then pass the pieces of the
JSON that describe the hardware to the test for each test invocation.
This is still under development, but I do not think that these details
matter at all, what we need at this point is to describe generic enough
information flow.

Couldn't agree more.

I guess that we need two more generic scripts in the format then, one
called before the test starts and one called after the test has
finished.

So something as:

{
  "pre_test": "/path/to/pre_script.sh",
  "post_test": "/path/to/post_script.sh",
  "hwconfs": [
    ...
  ]
}

And these scripts would need to actually be called before each test and
get JSON as a parameter as well.

e.g. for a serial port described as:

{
  "uid": "ttyUSB0-ttyUSB0-01",
  "rx": "ttyUSB0",
  "tx": "ttyUSB0",
  "hwflow": 0,
  "baud_rates": [
   9600,
   19200
  ]
}

We would get following:

------------------------------

* pre_script.sh gets passed following JSON:

{
  "uid": "ttyUSB0-ttyUSB0-01",
  "rx": "ttyUSB0",
  "tx": "ttyUSB0",
  "hwflow": 0,
  "baud_rate": 9600
}

* test is executed

* post_script.sh gets passed following JSON

{
  "uid": "ttyUSB0-ttyUSB0-01",
}

------------------------------

* pre_script.sh gets passed following JSON

{
  "uid": "ttyUSB0-ttyUSB0-01",
  "rx": "ttyUSB0",
  "tx": "ttyUSB0",
  "hwflow": 0,
  "baud_rate": 19200
}

* test is executed

* post_script.sh gets passed following JSON

{
  "uid": "ttyUSB0-ttyUSB0-01",
}

------------------------------

This changes things a bit, this means that the pre_script has to be
executed before each test execution and it's actually passed a JSON data
rather than simple value. So the test would need to serialize the data
and send the request instead.

The question is how should we propagate data to the test from a
post_script.sh. I guess that the output should be JSON as well and in a
case of binary data it should include a path to a file, since binary
does not work well for JSON.

So in the case of UART capture test the output from post_script.sh would
be something as:

{
	"capture": "/path/to/capture/file.bin"
}

Also in a case that we want the lab to send some binary data to the UART
during the test the pre_script.sh would get something as:

{
  "uid": "ttyUSB0-ttyUSB0-01",
  "hwflow": 0,
  "baud_rate": 19200,
  "transmit": "/path/to/transmit/file.bin"
}

However this means that the test needs to listen even before we call
this script, which again complicates things a bit.

Indeed, this is hard to desing especially since I do have very limited
set of usecases at the moment. But at least your UART case helped a lot,
thanks!
