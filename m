Hi Richie, Cyril,

Yes, adding flag would work.

OK, we document our willingness to add infrastructure for merging in rc,
if desired. I'm ok with this, if Cyril agree, I can send v2 for others to
ack/review it.

IMHO it's up to us whether we want to implement. I know just about few tests in
last 2 years - fanotify and IMA subsystems which has brought tests and they just
accepted our decision when we're going to merge it. People are happy that we
help them in tests, nobody haven't felt being put off by merging later.


Kind regards,
Petr
