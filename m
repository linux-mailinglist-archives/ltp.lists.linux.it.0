Correct + not pushing for it now. FYI iputils compilation worked even on old
CentOS 7 (well, meson and ninja got over epel).

15-SP2 (IMHO the oldest distro LTP upstream cares) has meson 0.54.2 and ninja
1.10, these would be enough for initial support. Therefore once we bump the
support higher (next year), we *could* consider moving away from autotools
(obviously starting to ask on automated-testing@yoctoproject.org if somebody has
problems with the dependencies.

+1 for removal. I wonder if anybody finds a time to do that.

Thank you! It still bothers me that building sched_football does not trigger
building a library, but at least it will work for a full build (building whole
LTP).

+1, I'll have look into it.

Kind regards,
Petr
