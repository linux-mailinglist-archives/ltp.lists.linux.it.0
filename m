Sounds good, +1

The main thing is that the comment doesn't make sense to me. In
particular the last sentence. Inline comments are also discouraged in
the style guide.

Also you can handle this depth-first, you just need to lift restrictions
before descending into the tree. So breadth-first is not really
important.

I think it's enough to explain at the top that descendents are bounded
by their ancestors. Then it's down to the reviewer or future developers
to figure out how the shell code handles that.
