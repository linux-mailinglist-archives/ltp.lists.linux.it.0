Yes, use the ioctl could be a solution for btrfs.
I ran a little test to understand what filesystem I can expect.
ioctl_loop05 is supported on a few filesystems, I tried listing them,
and on a few, I run the test:

| Filesystem    | tested | notes
+---------------+--------+----------------------------
|nfs            | no     | not tested, no idea.
|9p             | no     | not tested, no idea.
|ramfs          | no     | theoretically possible to have root on
ramfs, but I think it very unlikely
|btrfs          | yes    | both strategies have problems with it.
|xfs            | yes    | tested ok.
|ext2/ext3/ext4 | yes    | tested ok.
|minix          | yes    | max size is 64MB, possible but not
probable. Stat on mounted fs shows minor/major corresponding to
backend device.
|udf            | no     | optical media filesystem. Very unlikely to
have it as root filesystem. Stat on mounted fs shows minor/major
corresponding to backend device.
|sysv           | no     | not tested, no idea.
|ufs            | no     | not tested, no idea.
|f2fs           | yes    | tested ok.
|nilfs          | yes    | tested ok.
|exofs          | no     | it has been removed from kernel supported
FS since 5.1
|fuse           | no     | Unlikely.
|vfat           | no     | I'm not aware you can mount vfat as rootfs.
Since it lacks on a lot of features, it is unlikely having it as
rootfs.
|exfat          | no     | not tested, no idea.

It seems to me likely that btrfs is the only filesystem, among the
supported, that can present virtual devices with different
minor/major.
I'm not 100% sure, but I would bet on the fact that we can identify
these btrfs scenarios just by looking at the major number. If it is 0
we are dealing with it.
That been said, if major == 0 we can extract the backing device by
using the ioct, as you suggested:
        struct btrfs_ioctl_dev_info_args di_args = {0};
        ioctl(fd, BTRFS_IOC_DEV_INFO, &di_args)
and use di_args.path

Do you see any downside on such approach?

I ran a multiple tests with btrfs, and the mountinfo strategy.
I didn't find a single scenario where it succeded.
In my situation I always had that the backend device presnted a
different couple minor/major with the one listed by mountinfo.
Could you suggest a btrfs scenario where the mountinfo strategy ends
with success?
