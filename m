Not yet I plan to rewrite documentation once things are finalized

That more of less what the patchset attempts to do. It hardcodes the
runtime as a number instead of having DEFAULT_RUNTIME constant though.

I guess that would work reasonably well.

Sounds good. I will work on v2 that would include these changes.
