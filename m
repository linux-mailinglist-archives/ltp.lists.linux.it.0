We do sync more than needed here, since we are looking at the per device
counters we have to sync just the device we mount for the test, so this
is optimization for the case that the system has many dirty cases and
will need seconds or a minute to write them to the pernament storage.

Looking at the code closely I'm starting to think that the sync is not
required at all. What we do in the test is that we create file and sync
it to the external storage. Then we read it a few times and mesure
differences in cache. As far as I can tell we just need to drop the page
cache after we have read the file. What do you think?

In any case I would avoid changing the test before the release, but it's
certainly something we can look at after that.
