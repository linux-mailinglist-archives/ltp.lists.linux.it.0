That's using the space.  I had that discussion before in context of
this API, and I still think that reserving a small amount of space
that can be used for extensions is usually good practice.  Often
we get some of that for free by 64-bit aligning anyway, and adding
a bit more tends to also be useful.

This is what I meant.  Note that the userspace in this case also keeps a
case trying the old structure, but that does indeed require keeping the
userspace somewhat in lockstep if you do the renaming as in this example.
The better example would be one using a new new for the extended
structure, or requiring a feature macro to get the larger structure.

That is my (non-scientific) impression as well.
