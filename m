I didn't observe any issues setting the timeout very low
(<100ms). Worker's remove an item from the queue before trying to read
it, so they shouldn't get stuck in a restart cycle on the same file (if
thats what you meant).

I'm not sure if this is better or worse. In my sys folder there are
approx 35K files. Obviously a timeout of even 1s is far too long to read
all of them if they all timeout. In fact if we set the timeout as 100ms
then they would still require about 58 mins.

Of course most of them take a very short time on most systems. I guess
that ideally the timeout needs to be adapted as the test runs so that
all remaining files can be read. The issue with that though is that kill+wait+fork
takes more time than most reads. Although that can be measured as
well....

This issue is quite a lot like the issues we have with fuzzy sync. I
think it's maybe time to start dynamically adapting to system
performance. That's probably best left to another patch series though.
