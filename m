I don't think this is really a corner-case.  Perhaps filling the
*device*, with no file-system, might be a corner case.  But as you
say, this isn't exactly what it is doing -- it is filling a
file-system with a file that has all zeros.  The problem is that, for
the reasons expalined in [1] but also incorporated into comments in
the patch v2 [2] this is both unreliable and I do not think a good
exercise of the compression path.

The v2 patch was written to test both the same-page and compression
paths by explicitly alternating data that should hit both.  This is
essentially doing the same thing as the current test, but with
increased reliability of being able to correlate final stats.

I take the point that 'a' is different to '0', but as written the
kernel checks for zeros the same as any other value (it walks along by
unsigned-long and if the whole page matchs the first value, records
that value).  I haven't actually sent a patch to remove zram03.c;
since it doesn't try to assert anything it's not been unreilable.  But
I do think it's not really adding much useful coverage as is.
