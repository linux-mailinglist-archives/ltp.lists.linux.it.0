Well we usually need at least a week of pre release testing so somewhere
in the third week of January. I suppose that we can decide based on how
the patch queue would look like at that point.

It's a rather intrusive change, so I would like to get it more exposure
and testing. Generally it's not a good idea to do changes like that
right before the release.

I will try to have a look.
