You don't need irqbalance then :-p

The original bug this is intened to avoid was caused by the irqbalance
deamon silently failing.

My plan was to have a second heuristic based on the IRQ
distribution. However the intention was to make detection more sensitve
to bad setups. I think what you are suggesting is the opposite. So that
users can blindly run the test and let it figure out if it is
appropriate for the hardware.

I general I think it is best to write tests which figure out if they are
in the right environment. This makes all our lives easier. The problem
with this test in particular is the number of assumptions we have to
make about what a good IRQ distirbution looks like.

IRQs are (usually) evenly distributed for "performance". However not all
IRQs are equal, you might get better performance through an uneven
distribution. Especially if you only care about the performance some
tasks and not others. Also there are some reasons to isolate some CPUs
from IRQs regardless of performance.

Having said that we can probably find a heuristic for what a very bad
setup looks like i.e. (almost) all NIC IRQs on one CPU when there are
30+ CPUs and multiple NICs. That is one CPU is totally saturated with
IRQs from different NICs. This is a bit speculative so I'd like some
feedback from testing/community before putting effort into that.
