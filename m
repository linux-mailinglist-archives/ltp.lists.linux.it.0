Interesting, thanks for sharing this. BTW I'm not saying anybody is using nommu,
but I wonder if anybody really test it with LTP. And if yes, I wonder why we
don't have reports about tests broken in new API.

New C API is documented at our wiki: the API for using in the tests [1]
and the library itself [2]. (We also have shell API, but we can ignore it for
nommu.)

All files in lib/ directory which include tst_test.h are part of new C API. Main
file is lib/tst_test.c. LTP tests, which has been rewritten to new API include
tst_test.h, they are in testcases/ directory. Library has it's own tests (for
testing regression in in lib/newlib_tests/*.c.

The reason why Cyril wrote in 2016 new C API was that the old API was buggy
(tests randomly fails). Tests which are still using the old API (there is
ongoing rewrite) include test.h. The old API is not much documented.

Feel free to ask any more question.

Kind regards,
Petr
