Yes, I was just surprised that test ima_violations.sh really depends on
ima_policy=tcb or policy created by ima_policy.sh test.

This also means if somebody wants to test just ima_violations.sh,
he would need to have ima_policy=tcb. Dependency between IMA tests
is something LTP does not expect nor want.

Unfortunately due failures described above it'd be not good to accept this
patch.  But it's a very nice proof of concept how to use fsuuid, thank you.

Yes, but this config is 'n' by default. I wonder: shouldn't it be 'y' by
default, so that people who does not care get it enabled? Or is it a security
concern to get it enabled during just on boot by systemd?

Even if it were 'y' by default, there still might be some distros/people who
disable it... This is the source of all complications.

Sure, reboot is complication.

But you need to accept exact order of the tests. Or have detection,
but the detection does not work on disabled CONFIG_IMA_READ_POLICY
(which is the default when CONFIG_IMA_WRITE_POLICY is not set - again people can
have it unset). Actually ima_kexec.sh has broken detection - this gives TWARN
and TBROK (= failure) on disabled CONFIG_IMA_READ_POLICY:

		if [ "$policy_readable" != 1 ]; then
			tst_res TWARN "policy not readable, it might not contain required policy '$REQUIRED_POLICY'"
			res=TBROK
		fi
		tst_brk $res "unable to find a correct measurement"

Exact order is first test anything with ima_policy=tcb, then have custom policy.
Also, one should run tests with no IMA setup, then with ima_policy=tcb. Then
there are other unsupported/untested policies: ima_policy=secure_boot and
ima_policy=appraise_tcb, supporting them would obviously require reboot.

Thank you, very much appreciated!

Not sure if I understand you. FYI no mounted directory exists before test run,
nothing survives after test finishes.
Test is supposed to write *only* to it's temporary directory $TST_TMPDIR, which
is created by TST_NEEDS_TMPDIR=1 after test has started, this is the directory
which gets deleted.

Kind regards,
Petr
