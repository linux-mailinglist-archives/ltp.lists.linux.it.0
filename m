I'm not trying to hide it. I'm trying to write at least some
documentation for the shell loader, that is independed task from
converting the documentation we have for the older shell library into
rst and putting it in it's own menu item.

Indeed the shell loader is currently under construction, but it allows
us to write a simple tests already and should be good enough for simple
enough tests.

Yes, that is what I think would be ideal solution, much better than
mixing the two APIs in a single page.

You mean 'test.sh' I suppose, yes there are a few tests using it. We
should clean that up eventually.
