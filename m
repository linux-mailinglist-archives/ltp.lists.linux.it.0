Thanks for your input. I understand that you're for replacing in ioctl_ns06.c:

	int exists = access("/proc/self/ns/user", F_OK);

	if (exists < 0)
		tst_res(TCONF, "namespace not available");

with .needs_kconfigs:

	.needs_kconfigs = (const char *[]) {
		"CONFIG_USER_NS",
		NULL
	}

Because that was my question - really always prefer kconfig even there is a
simple runtime solution? I'd like to have some "rule" like conclusion we can
point during review.

Kind regards,
Petr
