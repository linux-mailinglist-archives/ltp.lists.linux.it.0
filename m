Hi!

Sounds good.

Also we probably need something along the lines:

Use runtime checks for kernel features
======================================

What is and what isn't supported by kernel is determined by the version
and configuration of the kernel the systems is currently running on.
That especially means that any checks done during the compilation cannot
be used to assume features supported by the kernel the tests end up
running on. The compile time checks, done by configure script, are only
useful for enabling fallback kernel API definitions when missing, as we
do in lapi/ directory.
