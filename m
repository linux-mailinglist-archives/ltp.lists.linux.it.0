This kind of failure may be highly unlikely on a vanilla kernel but it 
can easily happen due to incorrectly backported patches. IMHO it's 
better to get a failure and find out that the test case was invalid than 
to ignore a bug that may indicate deeper issues. We can always fix a 
broken test and possibly also update documentation of past changes in 
syscall behavior.

We find a fair amount of kernel bugs not because we have a specific 
targeted testcase for them but because they break test setup for 
something else. The subtests in fanotify14 may not comprehensively test 
all combinations of init flags but it's still "free" test coverage that 
will be useful for catching bugs.

I don't understand this sentence, especially which patch it's referring to.
