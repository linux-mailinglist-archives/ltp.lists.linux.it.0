This is slightly different topic (I wrote about forgetting to update status),
but it's even more important.

If it's obvious, that patch needs serious change I'm ok to set the status.
But because I mainly watch patchses in patchwork (and I'm not sure if I'm alone),
if the patch was posted recently, I wait few hours / one day to update the status
of the patch so that others can see it. But sure I'll stop doing it, if we all are
ok. (I should force to look into ML queue more often, there are also bug reports
and other discussions which aren't in patchwork.)

Kind regards,
Petr
