There are likely more nuances in the tests that use C, some set real
uid/git some only uid etc. So I wouldn't bother adding helper for six
tests or so and write directly just the shell helper.

Technically most of the C tests does not even need an user to be created
on the system. They just need UID/GID that is not priviledged, kernel
does not really care about the users in /etc/passwd that's purely
userspace thing. All that kernel does is to compare numbers before it
allows/disallows access. So we may get away with a function that returns
UID and GID suitable for the tests, or even a global varible.

Possibly we may add:

struct tst_usr {
	uid_t uid;
	gid_t gid;
};

struct tst_usr tst_usr = {
	.uid = 65534,
	.gid = 65534,
};

and add an option to override these values with TST_USR_UID and
TST_USR_GID.
