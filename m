Good idea, perhaps check with Git that it is a clean
checkout. Especially because one could accidentally copy private files
into the container.

I'm not sure, you can export the LTP dir as a volume and use 'podman cp'
to copy the headers to somewhere on your host. This does feel hacky
though.

I suppose if clangd can run inside the container then it should be
possible to export its ports and connect to it from outside. However I
just have a checkout of the musl repo and manually search it.

Thank you,
