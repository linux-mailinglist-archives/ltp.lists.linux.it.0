Not at all. As I replied to Tim, there is no secret sauce in runltp or
kirk. In the end it's a tool to execute a test binaries. If you have a
system that can execute binaries, reliably transfer logs and handle
kernel crashes you can as well just execute the tests yourself. All you
need from us is a tooling that will produce a list(s) of tests to
execute.

Indeed. However I stil think that there are reusable parts that may be
worth putting together.

This reminds me:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory

If we apply that to software not being able to inovate keeps you doing
work that shouldn't needed to be done in the first place.
