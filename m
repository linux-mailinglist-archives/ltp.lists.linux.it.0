+1. BTW it should be either ``generate_arch.sh`` (double `` is used for
other commands, e.g. ``make check`` or ``./configure``) or it could be a link to
a source:

:master:`include/lapi/syscalls/generate_arch.sh` script as following:

I like links, because reader can see the script content. Also it can help to
verify whether the script is still at the repository (was not moved/deleted).

very nit: "path/to/Linux/kernel/sources" (upper "L", which you use later, also
it's used in the script).

Otherwise LGTM, thanks a lot for bothering with the docs.

Kind regards,
