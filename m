The rest of the space should be being used unless it is buggy. It's a
circle buffer with multiple (variable length) items delimited by \0.

However it's a very good point you make. It's true that having a
multi-item queue on each worker is not necessary.

At most we need two buffers (or a flip buffer) on each worker, one
containing the current path being worked on and one with the next path
to be worked on.

This would be much simpler than the circle buffer queue I originally
implemented. It may mean the workers are more likely to starve while
waiting for the main process. However the main process usually adds work
far faster than the workers can consume it.

So we should probably swap the queue for a flip buffer. I'll look into
that and merge this patchset as it is for now.
