We should take this is a bugfix because it doesn't change behavior.

But then we should follow this up with a patch series that tries to
rectify the open/close imbalance because I find that pretty ugly. That's
at least my opinion.

We should aim to only generate an open event when may_open() succeeds
and don't generate a close event when the open has failed. Maybe:

+#ifdef CONFIG_FSNOTIFY
+#define file_nonotify(f) ((f)->f_mode |= __FMODE_NONOTIFY)
+#else
+#define file_nonotify(f) ((void)(f))
+#endif

will do.

Basic open permissions failing should count as failure to open and thus
also turn of a close event.

The somewhat ugly part is imho that security hooks introduce another
layer of complexity. While we do count security_file_permission() as
a failure to open we wouldn't e.g., count security_file_post_open() as a
failure to open (Though granted here that "*_post_open()" makes it
easier.). But it is really ugly that LSMs get to say "no" _after_ the
file has been opened. I suspect this is some IMA or EVM thing where they
hash the contents or something but it's royally ugly and I complained
about this before. But maybe such things should just generate an LSM
layer event via fsnotify in the future (FSNOTIFY_MAC) or something...
Then userspace can see "Hey, the VFS said yes but then the MAC stuff
said no."
