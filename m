Huh?  Absolute pathname is the one that _starts_ with '/'; e.g. "../include"
is relative, not absolute, despite having a '/' in it.

Er...  Intent was to verify two things: that anything longer than PATH_MAX triggers
ENAMETOOLONG, but anything up to PATH_MAX does not.  Having a pathname of exactly
4095 '/' (or interleaved . and / in the same amount, etc.) be rejected with ENAMETOOLONG
is just as much of a failure as not triggering ENAMETOOLONG on anything longer...

FWIW, I considered something like
	mkdir("subdirectory", 0700);
concatenating enough copies of "subdirectory/../" to get just under PATH_MAX and appending
"././././././././" to the end, so that truncation to PATH_MAX and to PATH_MAX-1 would
both be otherwise valid paths; decided that it's better to keep it simpler - a pile of
slashes is easier to produce and would resolve to a valid directory if not for the
total length restrictions.
