Staging and unstable could equally mean the test itself is not fininshed
IMO. I didn't suggest next for exactly the reason mentioned, but it
might be the better choice.

Then the test has a useless or misleading comment saying it was
developed against a feature still in development. It's trivial to remove
such comments or meta-data. I expect test authors will do it themselves
and if they don't we can rethink accepting such tests.

Also the patch uses the meta-data to print a hint. That way we do not
need to look at the source code, runtest file and LTP version before
deciding on the severity of a problem. Doing extra work upstream saves a
lot of work downstream.

Finally note that the plan is to schedule tests without runtest files
for parallel execution. That requires meta-data.
