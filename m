		  Just: "in the future."

"next future" sounds like we are moving to a parallel reality or some
kind of scifi stuff.

   Kirk

> +Test new syscalls
> +-----------------
> +
> +Syscalls and new syscalls flags are added to Linux kernel each development

> +would store comprehensive list of syscalls, but there are a few places to look
> +at:
> +
> +- `man-pages repository <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/docs/man-pages/man-pages.git>`_

> +  functionalities.
> +- `LWN <http://lwn.net>`_ weekly editions.
> +- `linux-api mailing list <https://lore.kernel.org/linux-api/>`_ where
> +  changes in kernel userspace API are discussed.

> +
> +Rewrite old API tests
> +---------------------
> +
> +LTP has a long story and, at certain point of its development, new API were
> +introduced to make kernel testing easier and more efficient. This happened when
> +lots of tests were still using old, messy API.
> +
> +Some of these tests have been converted to the new API, but this process is
> +still ongoing for many others. To have an overview of the tests using old API,
> +please run the following command inside the LTP root folder:
> +
> +.. code-block:: bash
> +
> +        git --no-pager grep -l 'include "test\.h"' testcases/
> +
> +Fade out shell scripts
> +----------------------
> +
> +LTP was initially thought as a generic framework for running tests with both
> +shell and plain-C languages. Even if writing tests in shell script might seem
> +easy, the reality is that debugging and maintaining certain test cases is
> +difficult and slow down the whole validation process. This is particularly
> +visible for cgroup tests, since shell doesn't add enough control over race
> +conditions.
> +
> +LTP maintainers are working on converting shell scripts to plain-C tests, in
> +order to reduce the impact that shell scripts might have on the overall kernel
> +testing.
> +
> +For a complete list of shell tests, please run the following command inside the
> +LTP root folder:
> +
> +.. code-block:: bash
> +
> +        git --no-pager grep -l -e '^\. .*_lib\.sh' -e '^\. .*test.sh'
> +
> +LTP also provides a shell loader implementation for plain-C tests inside
> +:master:`testcases/lib/tst_run_shell.c` and it permits to run shell tests
> +into plain-C LTP API, featuring :ref:`struct tst_test` initializations and a
> +direct access to kernel syscalls.

Maybe we should link the (now empty) shell API page here:

https://linux-test-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/api_shell_tests.html

I plan to add the shell loader documentation there one day.


Otherwise it looks good to me, thanks for writing this.
