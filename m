I was looking for kernel config options, that could modify bpf behavior
and also unprivileged_bpf_disable (set to 0 for me), but nothing stood out.

Ok, I get that.


I did some more digging and bisecting. First I bisected the mainline
kernel and found, that the commit 2c78ee898 ("bpf: Implement CAP_BPF")
makes the check run successful. This is only in linux >= 5.8.
But my 5.4 ubuntu kernel also successfully ran the check, so I also
bisected ubuntu sources [1] and found this commit to be the fix here:
2fa9ab45c ("bpf: No need to simulate speculative domain for immediates")
This commit is also in the mainline kernel, but only in >= 5.13.

I guess the check you implemented now disables the test for a lot of
kernels, that do not have a patch like this... I will stop here and just
accept, that the test is not running successfully in my case. But still
wanted to share this information.
