The UNLIMITED_RUNTIME would not be needed anymore. Because runtime will
mean _only_ for how long will a few tests spend in the main loop.
Infinite loop does not make any sense. The tst_runtime will be basically
renamed to timeout and TST_UNLIMITED_RUNTIME becomes
TST_UNLIMITED_TIMEOUT.

The point is to separate timeout, which is a guess on upper bound on the
time the test will spend executing from a runtime which is the exact
time a few tests will spend looping in the test function.

No, it's the other way around. The timeout is a guessed upper bound for
a test execution time. It's for everything the test does and in most of
the cases only the default timeout (which is kind of safety measure) is
sufficient. Then there are tests that do some work that is not time
bound, e.g. I/O. In that case we set the timeout in the tst_test
structure to some value we measured in practice and that plus the
default timeout will become the overall test timeout.

Then we have a few testcases that do a loop in the test function that
takes exact time. In that case we know that we spend exactly runtime in
the test function, but there is a setup and cleanup as well. So we add
the default timeout to the runtime to get the overall timeout. There may
be also a case where the test setup for such test takes some time, in
that case we would set both the timeout and runtime in the tst_test
structure. The timeout would be upper bound for the test setup and
runtime would be exactly for how long will the test function loop.

Mainly this would make sure that if timeout part of the overall test
time limit gets multiplied, because we are running on a slow system, the
runtime will not. Because we could control the timeout and runtime
separately.

That was my long term plan.
