FYI tst_rhost_run() is used for testing itself as well, more than for setup and
cleanup:

$ git grep -l tst_rhost_run |wc -l
35

Therefore we can rethink network test setup, but tst_rhost_run() will be needed
anyway.

Also, you call it a hack, but it works standalone, without any runner. I would
be careful to add kirk as a hard dependency to run a single test without a
strong reason (sure, using kirk to handle metadata to run tests in paralel or
replace runtest files will be a great improvement, but I would like to still
keep executing a test itself by just calling it with proper PATH setup).

FYI "multimachine tests": I know only about 1 test which needs more than a
single machine: IPsec (implemented in openQA instead of LTP [1]).

Kind regards,
Petr
