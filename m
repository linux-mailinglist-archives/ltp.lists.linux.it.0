You're right that's not needed for detecting the update.
But it's needed for tests which would like to detect whether policy contain
required items. Because without CONFIG_IMA_READ_POLICY when tests fails due old
kernel or unsuitable policy we have no way to detect. And TBROK is here false
positive which needs to be resolved by testers. But that's IMHO unsolvable.

+1, I'll remove it for IMA in v2.
