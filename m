Sometimes they don't bother. Sometimes there's a language barrier. Sometimes
they can't get anything newer than 2.6 working because that's the BSP they were
given so what's the point of trying to engage upstream? Sometimes they think
it's their upstream vendor's responsibility. Sometimes they poke their head up
and get it bit off ala http://landley.net/notes-2008.html#11-12-2008 and then
that serves as a warning to others for generations. Sometimes the company's
legal department thinks it's a terrible idea to attract attention from people
like the SFLC. And sometimes...


The SmartFusion 2 project I was doing on cortex-m was for a project that was to
be launched into space on a NASA rocket, and thus fell under ITAR export
regulations (as the entire US space program has since 1996 due to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations#:~:text=Intelsat
) and my manager explained it to me as:

"If I buy a screwdriver from Home Depot, it's just a screwdriver. If I use it to
turn a screw on a spacecraft it is now a munition and cannot be discussed with
non-US persons".

The stupid linked above was:

1) cryptography was categorized as a munition until Bill Clinton relaxed it via
executive order, because 56 bit https was preventing anybody from trusting the
web with their credit card data.

2) Before that, in 1996, china wanted to launch a satellite into space with
crypto stuff so they negotiated with the USA to get some cryptographic hardware
which was delivered/installed under armed guard and escorted to the launch pad.

3) The rocket blew up on launch, scattering debris over a chinese city (becuase
of COURSE china's rocket launches go over large population centers). The crypto
hardware was never recovered.

4) It became a scandal. Congress freaked. And somehow in the scuffle ITAR export
regulations were extended from cryptography to the entire US space program.

5) The US space program dried up and blew away, as engineers had to choose
between "I can work on space stuff" and "I can have any sort of professional
network online". (Because who online is a "non-US person"? That includes canada.
You can't discuss ITAR subjects with canadians. Or foreign nationals living in
the USA. You couldn't ask Alan Cox a question about an ITAR project.)

So that's a whole category that stays very quiet about what they do, and whose
legal analysis of the GPL is "we're making 3 of these and shooting them into
space, if you retrieve one from space and demand source code from us we will
forward you to the relevant federal agencies, and there's a nonzero chance
you'll be on a black site in Diego Garcia within 24 hours where they will figure
out how you did that. Or maybe you'll get the code. Who knows?"

Me, I try to avoid that kind of contract...

The thing is if you post something _once_ it gets ignored, and if you follow-up
long enough for it to go in (which often takes years), it will then get ripped
out again a few years later because "we never hear from anybody who uses this".

Engaging with the community is signing up for an ongoing commitment.

I fight hard to get current versions of everything to work on all my supported
targets. This requires regular regression testing, and I maintain a pile of
patches that I post here periodically but I fully admit will probably never go in:

  https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2302.2/05594.html

(Sigh, now that 6.7 is out I should post the new round...)

People who want to use my kernels as a source are welcome to do so (and I've
seen my patches quietly show up in other projects), but getting upstream to
actually _fix_ anything? Every one of those patches had a link to the previous
time it was posted to the list and ignored.

I mean literally, the first of those patches teaches the makefile to autodetect
whether $PREFIX-cc is gcc or llvm and just do the right thing, and I was told
that they actively didn't want it to:

https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2302.2/07184.html

That is modern linux-kernel development.

Sigh, I should start caring about riscv. I added or1k support, I should do
riscv. (Except I did or1k because I found it in actual hardware, the Orange Pi
3b's power controller is an or1k asic so I needed an or1k toolchain to build
some of u-boot's firmware or else the board couldn't reboot, and there was a
qemu-system-or1k already, which turned into adding it to mkroot via a long
https://lore.kernel.org/openrisc/ZX1xbs_AGdgLgcx7@antec/ thread with its
developers. Alas I still can't get qemu to exit (I.E. virtually reboot or power
off), apparently I need to reinstall my laptop to have a new enough version of
python 3 to build a newer qemu with. It's on the todo list...)

I still have a hard time considering riscv anything other than open source's
version of Itanium. Promises of ubiquity, but even a 28 nanometer mask is still
6 figures before you run any wafers and your mask build process is sucking in
all the black box libraries the fab can sell you, so what does "open" really get
you here? Cortex-m got cheap when the superh patents expired so Arm didn't have
to pay royalties to hitachi (renesas?) for the thumb instruction set anymore,
and they belt those suckers en masse amortizing the up-front costs over ENORMOUS
volume.

And yes, j-core was trying to fix the closed source library and toolchain issues
back when I was still working with them. Among other things fishing
Google/skywater's openlane toolchain build out of their magic docker and
reproducing it under a vanilla debootstrap, ala
https://github.com/j-core/openlane-vhdl-build (As with most corporate
clusterfscks, once you dig far enough it turns out you can throw over 90% of it
out...)

But these days I'm trying to get toybox to 1.0...

I would very much like to add more nommu targets to mkroot, can I get your
build/config info offline? (I tried fishing configs out of buildroot a couple
years ago, but after the THIRD one where the secret was "use very old versions
of packages, the current stuff is broken"... And the problems were things like
"the conversion to device tree deleted a huge chunk of this infrastructure", not
simple fixes.)
