IIRC the reason I started doing it in parallel is because sequential
opens and reads are even slower and unreliable. Some level of parallism
is required, but too much and it causes issues.

Thinking about it now, on a single or two core system only one worker
process will be spawned. Which could get blocked for a long time on some
reads because of the way some sys/proc files are implemented.

The worker count can be overridden with -w if someone wants to try
increasing it to see if that actually helps on systems with <3
cpus. Also the number of reads is set to 3 in the runtest file, that can
be reduced to 1 with -r.

I don't think I'd want to run that. IMO just doing enough to test
parallel accesses is whats required. More than that we will run into
diminishing returns . However I'm not against creating another runtest
file/entry for that.

On bigger systems I think the test is already quite limited even though
it does 3 reads. It only spwans a max of 15 workers which should prevent
it from causing huge lock contention on machines with >16 CPUs. At least
I've not seen problems with that.

It looks like the log from lkft is for a smaller machine?
