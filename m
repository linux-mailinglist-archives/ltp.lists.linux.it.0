Hi Richard, all,

[ I realized that we went quite far to kirk topic, which would be interesting to
Cyril, Andrea and possible other people developers or users, therefore Cc them.
Replying to this thread:

I added few final points below.

As I wrote previously, kirk is possible to be used as nearly drop-in runltp
replacement run on the SUT. It's not the intended use-case (we aim it to be run
on host), but still supported use case.

I would say adopting kirk in minimalistic way (or identify what you need and
it's still missing) would be sure safer in a long term.
