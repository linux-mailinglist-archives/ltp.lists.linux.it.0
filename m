Great, thanks! (As I wrote this is the only thing which should be fixed).

Sure, let's keep it on the linux-test-project/ltp unless it shows there is =
some
problem.

Adding 'ref: whatever-branch-we-want-for-ci' does not seem to be too
complicated, but let's keep master now (I'll have look into it later, wheth=
er
it's working as expected, then we can reconsider it).

Sure, let's ignore it.

FYI I did not think to add another layer. It would be git push in
ci-patchwork-trigger.yml (more code, but OTOH ci-docker-build.yml would not=
 have
to be modified).

Also, you decide to trigger ci-docker-build.yml via ci-patchwork-trigger.ym=
l,
which ignores ci-sphinx-doc.yml. Therefore patches which modify just
documentation, e.g. even with this CI we can have changes which break
readthedocs.org.

I created a single job ci-sphinx-doc.yml because 1) it's easier to spot wha=
t got
broken 2) I consider building the doc in all distros as a waste of time. Sh=
ould
we reconsider it? I could move building of the doc to ci-sphinx-doc.yml and
remove ci-sphinx-doc.yml. Other option is that you trigger also ci-sphinx-d=
oc.yml
(nothing urgent, can be done later).

Sure, it can wait.

I don't consider this important until LTP is in the state when it's clean. =
ATM I
would do it only for new files. For modified files I would print warning on=
ly
when there are new warnings (compare count warning on master; comparing dif=
f of
warning on master vs. particular patchset will not work because line number
changes).

It should be warning only (not a failure).

I guess this will be separate workflow, right? Once anybody start on it, I =
guess
we should have script which takes input of changed files and generates outp=
ut
of make check-* commands.
