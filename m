That sounds too complex for a test or two we are usually getting during
the release cycle.

Note that people who contribute the functionality to the kernel are used
to wait for next release window, kernel releases are aprox. twice as
fast as LTP.

So far really nobody complained, which may not be a good metric. But
still unless there is a evidence that this happens I wouldn't consider
spending effort on this.
