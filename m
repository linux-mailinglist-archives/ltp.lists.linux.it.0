How about we allow an arbitrary list of callbacks for the initial
implementation?

e.g.

{
  "cmds" : {
    "activate-robot-1": "robocmd 1",
    "launch-missiles": "echo 'fire!' > /dev/stty1",
    ...
  }
  "hwconfs": [ ... ]
}

As we add tests it may turn out there are only a limited number of
callbacks practically possible. Then we can standardise on those.

Yes, or base64 encode it if the data is small. Or send

{ ...., "trailing_binary": 1 }\n

Then transmit the binary data after the '}\n'

Not if we make the cmds free form. Using JSON makes perfect sense
IMO. I'd like to combine efforts here and use the JSON parser for the
parallel test executor IPC.
