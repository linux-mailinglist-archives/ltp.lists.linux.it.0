Violations occur when a file in policy is already opened for read and
is being opened for write, or the reverse.  After the builtin policy is
replaced with the custom policy based on the UUID, running the
violation test fails because the UUID is reset by the call to
ima_setup().  So the file being opened doesn't match any policy rule.

Oh, I didn't realize this.  Fedora (and RHEL) enable
CONFIG_IMA_WRITE_POLICY.

Let's try to avoid this solution as much as possible.

Ok, I'll look into this.

Instead of ima_setup() setting the UUID to a new different value, if
additional rules cannot be written (require_policy_writable) the UUID
could be set to the existing policy rules UUID.

Thanks,
