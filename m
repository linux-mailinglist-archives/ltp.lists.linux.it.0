Having reduced runtime for CI makes sense, as you said you are making up
for the reduction by the number of testruns. It may not work well for
fuzzy sync though where we depend on having good enough sampling period.

Also limiting the smallest multiplier to be 0.1 or so does make sense. I
assume that if we set it to 0.01 or smaller most tests with runtime
woudn't even execute.

I guess that we need to make sure that the runtime stays positive. So
maybe we need something as:

runtime = MAX(2, tst_test->runtime * runtime_mul)

> So I would like to start the work from this point to reduce execution time.

Sounds good to me.
