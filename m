That can always happen as plenty of changes will break LTP test
expectations, but not real programs.

If the real issue is LTP releases, then why not exclude tests for new
features from them? I assume it's only a small number of commits which
would need to be removed. Possibly we could tag them in git when merging
so it is not a lot more work for whoever does the release (namely
Cyril) to create a branch without them.

My main concern is this will throw up a barrier to motivated
contributors working on the cutting edge.
