Maybe getting a little off-topic here, but I'll just send links here.
Who knows it might be useful to others.

Recently I have been experimenting with minimal builds, this is a bunch of
scripts, configs and a couple of patches I currently have:

     https://github.com/gregungerer/simple-linux

Mostly the kernel builds use the architecture defconfigs, but for armnommu
versatile it was easier to use a dedicated config and patch:

     https://github.com/gregungerer/simple-linux/blob/master/configs/linux-6.6-armnommu-versatile.config
     https://github.com/gregungerer/simple-linux/blob/master/patches/linux-6.6-armnommu-versatile.patch

Anyway the scripting uses the newest package versions of everything
(binutils, gcc, linux, uClibc, busybox).

Regards
Greg
