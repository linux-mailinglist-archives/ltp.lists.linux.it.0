The tests are still failing on upstream:

[    0.343845] alg: self-tests for rfc4106(gcm(aes)) using rfc4106(gcm_base(ctr(aes-generic),ghash-generic)) failed (rc=-2)

To me it still seems like commit 37da5d0ffa7b ("crypto: api - Do not wait for
tests during registration") is just broken and should be reverted.

Besides the test failures, it looks like there's no longer any guarantee that
algorithms are actually available now that their module is loaded.

E.g. consider if someone does 'modprobe aesni-intel' and then immediately
creates a dm-crypt device.  Now it sounds like the AES-NI algorithms might not
have finished being tested yet and the generic algorithms can be used instead,
resulting in a performance regression.

I understand that you want to try to fix the edge cases in "fallback" ciphers.
But "fallback" ciphers have always seemed like a bad design due to how they use
the crypto API recursively.  I think the algorithms that use them should
generally be migrated off of them, e.g. as I did in commit f235bc11cc95
("crypto: arm/aes-neonbs - go back to using aes-arm directly").  That fixed the
problem in aes-neonbs that seems to have triggered this work in the first place.
