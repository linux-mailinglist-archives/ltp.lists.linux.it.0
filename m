It's only a problem because of LTP releases. We can just fix or revert
tests otherwise. Especially if the test author is also developing the
kernel feature and updating the test in lockstep.

Without LTP releases then a test can be added for a feature only in RC
and removed again. Only people who test the RC will get a result other
than TCONF from the test before it disappears again or is updated to
support the final feature.

Assuming of course people update LTP from HEAD on a regular basis. Which
of course they won't or can't, so we have releases. We don't have a
separate unstable branch because no one has volunteered to create and
maintain it. If we did we could just add such tests to that.
