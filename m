We don't want to remove coverage of ZRAM_SAME! A bug in ZRAM_SAME is a
potential expoit or data-corruption.

If you want to change the test you have to show where ZRAM_SAME is being
covered instead.

It's not that I think ZRAM_SAME is any more or less important than the
true compression path. It's that if we never allow coverage to be
swapped out or removed, then we systematically increase coverage.
