I'm sorry, copy paste error. This was meant to be a new struct,
e.g. struct tst_nodemap_val. But I see you below suggested struct tst_numa.

Make sense.

+1, thanks for suggesting a proper struct :).

BTW why we can use enum tst_numa_types in struct and not as function parameter?

-struct tst_nodemap *tst_get_nodemap(int type, size_t min_mem_kb);
+struct tst_nodemap *tst_get_nodemap(enum tst_numa_types type, size_t min_mem_kb);

Old toolchains? Maybe not needed nowadays? I guess with using enum we could get
rid of the check for enum validity:
if (type & ~(TST_NUMA_MEM))
	tst_brk(TBROK, "Invalid type %i\n", type);

Correct, file is in libs/numa/tst_numa.c. But how about use predecessor check?

if (tst_test->numa) {
#ifdef HAVE_NUMA_V2
	...
#else
	tst_brk(TCONF, NUMA_ERROR_MSG);
#endif
}

With help we would even get rid of else part of the compile check in the
tests:

#else
TST_TEST_TCONF(NUMA_ERROR_MSG);

But we would have modify lib/Makefile to conditionally add "-lnuma -lltpnuma".
"-lnuma" would be based on NUMA_LIBS (stored in include/mk/config.mk, detected
in m4/ltp-numa.m4), e.g. something like this could work:

ifneq ($(NUMA_LIBS),)
LDLIBS += $(NUMA_LIBS) -lltpnuma
endif

Kind regards,
Petr
