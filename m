Yes that is right.

The validation is primarily checking my assumptions. We don't want to
cut the name off at a '_' then get more confusing errors in the future.

Well I assumed there wasn't, but it seems this was actually thought
about and specified to some extent. I should have scanned the docs.

Thats the name of the "hierarchy" AFAICT. I don't think that is the
controller/subsystem name. Those characters would be a pain for naming
things in C.

None of the existing upstream controllers contain a _ unless we are
missing one or more. However we should allow it, so I'll add it.

It's not exposed to userland or specified in the docs. I suppose I could
issue a WARN if it is over 32 though. Mostly likely if that happens then
there is a parsing error.

The kernel will also issue a WARN if the subsystem name is over 32.
