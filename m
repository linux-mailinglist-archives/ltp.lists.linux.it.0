the pwd is one member of fs_struct:

struct fs_struct {
	int users;
	spinlock_t lock;
	seqcount_spinlock_t seq;
	int umask;
	int in_exec;
	struct path root, pwd;
} __randomize_layout;

And fs_struct is one member of struct task_struct:

	/* Filesystem information: */
	struct fs_struct		*fs;

In my opinion, the pwd will inherit from parent naturally if there is no a explicit change in fork.

Regards,
Gongyi
