 Writing tests
 =============
 
+This document describes LTP guidelines and it's intended for anybody who wants
+to write or to modify a LTP testcase. It's not a definitive guide and it's not,
+by any means, a substitute for common sense.
+
+Guide to clean and understandable code
+--------------------------------------
+
+Testcases require that the source code is easy to follow. When a test starts to
+fail, the failure has to be analyzed and clean test codebase makes this task
+much easier and quicker.
+
+Keep things simple
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It's worth to keep testcases simple or, better, as simple as possible.
+
+The kernel and libc are tricky beasts and the complexity imposed by their
+interfaces is quite high. Concentrate on the interface you want to test and
+follow the UNIX philosophy.
+
+It's a good idea to make the test as self-contained as possible too, ideally
+tests should not depend on tools or libraries that are not widely available.
+
+Do not reinvent the wheel!
+
+* Use LTP standard interface
+* Do not add custom PASS/FAIL reporting functions
+* Do not write Makefiles from scratch, use LTP build system instead
+* Etc.
+
+Keep functions and variable names short
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Choosing a good name for an API functions or even variables is a difficult
+task do not underestimate it.
+
+There are a couple of customary names for different things that help people to
+understand code, for example:
+
+* For loop variables are usually named with a single letter ``i``, ``j``, ...
+* File descriptors ``fd`` or ``fd_foo``.
+* Number of bytes stored in file are usually named as ``size`` or ``len``
+* Etc.
+
+Do not overcomment
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Comments can sometimes save your day, but they can easily do more harm than
+good. There has been several cases where comments and actual implementation
+drifted slowly apart which yielded into API misuses and hard to find bugs.
+Remember there is only one thing worse than no documentation: wrong
+documentation.
+
+Ideally, everybody should write code that is obvious, which unfortunately isn't
+always possible. If there is a code that requires to be commented, keep it
+short and to the point. These comments should explain *why* and not *how*
+things are done.
+
+Never ever comment the obvious.
+
+In case of LTP testcases, it's customary to add an asciidoc formatted comment
+paragraph with highlevel test description at the beginning of the file right
+under the GPL SPDX header. This helps other people to understand the overall
+goal of the test before they dive into the technical details. It's also
+exported into generated documentation hence it should mostly explain what is
+tested.
+
+DRY (Code duplication)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Copy & paste is a good servant but very poor master. If you are about to copy a
+large part of the code from one testcase to another, think what would happen if
+you find bug in the code that has been copied all around the tree. What about
+moving it to a library instead?
+
+The same goes for short but complicated parts, whenever you are about to copy &
+paste a syscall wrapper that packs arguments accordingly to machine
+architecture or similarly complicated code, put it into a header instead.
+
+C coding style
+--------------
+
+LTP adopted `Linux kernel coding style <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html>`_.
+Run ``make check`` in the test's directory and/or use ``make check-$TCID``, it
+uses (among other checks) our vendored version of
+`checkpatch.pl <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/scripts/checkpatch.pl>`_
+script from kernel git tree.
+
+.. note::
+      If ``make check`` does not report any problems, the code still may be wrong
+      as all tools used for checking only look for common mistakes.
+
+The following linting code can be found when we run ``make check``:
+
+.. list-table::
+    :header-rows: 1
+
+    * - Linting code
+      - Message
+      - Explanation
+
+    * - LTP-001
+      - Library source files have ``tst_`` prefix
+      - API source code is inside headers in ``include/{empty}*.h``,
+        ``include/lapi/{empty}*.h`` (backward compatibility for old kernel and
+        libc) and C sources in ``lib/{empty}*.c``. Files must have ``tst_``
+        prefix.
+
+    * - LTP-002
+      - ``TST_RET`` and ``TST_ERR`` are never modified by test library functions
+      - The test author is guaranteed that the test API will not modify these
+        variables. This prevents silent errors where the return value and
+        errno are overwritten before the test has chance to check them.
+
+        The macros which are clearly intended to update these variables. That
+        is ``TEST`` and those in ``tst_test_macros.h``. Are of course allowed to
+        update these variables.
+
+    * - LTP-003
+      - Externally visible library symbols have the ``tst_`` prefix
+      - Functions, types and variables in the public test API should have the
+        ``tst_`` prefix. With some exceptions for symbols already prefixed with
+        ``safe_`` or ``ltp_``.
+
+        Static (private) symbols should not have the prefix.
+
+    * - LTP-004
+      - Test executable symbols are marked ``static``
+      - Test executables should not export symbols unnecessarily. This means
+        that all top-level variables and functions should be marked with the
+        ``static`` keyword. The only visible symbols should be those included
+        from shared object files.
+
+    * - LTP-005
+      - Array must terminate with a sentinel value (i.e. ``NULL`` or ``{}``)
+      - When defining arrays in the ``struct tst_test`` structure, we need to
+        end the array items with a sentinel ``NULL`` value.
+
+Shell coding style
+------------------
+
+When writing testcases in shell, write in *portable shell* only, it's a good
+idea to try to run the test using alternative shell (alternative to bash, for
+example dash) too.
+
+*Portable shell* means Shell Command Language as defined by POSIX with an
+exception of few widely used extensions, namely **local** keyword used inside of
+functions and ``-o`` and ``-a`` test parameters (that are marked as obsolete in
+POSIX).
+
+You can either try to run the testcases in Debian which has ``/bin/sh`` pointing
+to ``dash`` by default, or to install ``dash`` on your favorite distribution,
+then use it to run tests. If your distribution lacks ``dash`` package, you can
+always compile it from `sources <http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/files/>`_.
+
+Run ``make check`` in the test's directory and/or use ``make check-$TCID.sh``.
+It uses (among other checks) our vendored version of
+`checkbashism.pl <https://salsa.debian.org/debian/devscripts/raw/master/scripts/checkbashisms.pl>`_
+from Debian that is used to check for non-portable shell code.
+
+.. note::
+
+      If ``make check`` does not report any problems the code still may be wrong,
+      as ``checkbashisms.pl`` is used for checking only common mistakes.
+
+Here there are some common sense style rules for shell
+
+* Keep lines under 80 chars
+* Use tabs for indentation
+* Keep things simple, avoid unnecessary subshells
+* Don't do confusing things (i.e. don't name your functions like common shell
+  commands, etc.)
+* Quote variables
+* Be consistent
+
+3 Backwards compatibility
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+LTP test should be as backward compatible as possible. Think of an enterprise
+distributions with long term support (more than five years since the initial
+release) or of an embedded platform that needs to use several years old
+toolchain supplied by the manufacturer.
+
+Therefore LTP test for more current features should be able to cope with older
+systems. It should at least compile fine and if it's not appropriate for the
+configuration it should return ``TCONF``.
+
+There are several types of checks we use:
+
+* The *configure script* is usually used to detect availability of a function
+  declarations in system headers. It's used to disable tests at compile time or
+  to enable fallback definitions.
+
+* Checking the ``errno`` value is another type of runtime check. Most of the
+  syscalls returns either ``EINVAL`` or ``ENOSYS`` when syscall was not
+  implemented or was disabled upon kernel compilation.
+
+* LTP has kernel version detection that can be used to disable tests at runtime.
+  Unfortunately, the kernel version does not always corresponds to a well
+  defined feature set, as distributions tend to backport hundreds of patches
+  while the kernel version stays the same. Use with caution.
+
+* Lately, we added a kernel ``.config`` parser. A test can define a boolean
+  expression of kernel config variables that has to be satisfied in order to run
+  a test. At the moment, this is mostly used for kernel namespaces.
+
+* Sometimes it makes sense to define a few macros instead of creating a
+  configure test. One example is Linux specific POSIX clock ids in
+  ``include/lapi/posix_clocks.h``
+
+Dealing with messed up legacy code
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+LTP still contains a lot of old and messy code and we are cleaning it up as
+fast as we can but, despite the decade of efforts, there is still a lot of it.
+If you start modifying old or a messy testcase and your changes are more
+complicated than simple typo fixes, you should convert the test into a new
+library first.
+
+It's also much easier to review the changes if you split them into a smaller
+logical groups. The same goes for moving files: if you need to rename or to move
+files, do it in a separate patch.
+
+License
+~~~~~~~
+
+Code contributed to LTP should be licensed under GPLv2+ (GNU GPL version 2 or
+any later version).
+
+Use ``SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later``
+
+LTP Structure
+-------------
+
+The structure of LTP is quite simple. Each test is a binary written either in
+portable shell or C. The test gets a configuration via environment variables
+and/or command line parameters, it prints additional information into the
+stdout and reports overall success/failure via the exit value.
+
+Tests are generally placed under the ``testcases/`` directory. Everything that
+is a syscall or (slightly confusingly) libc syscall wrapper, goes under
+``testcases/kernel/syscalls/``.
+
+There is also ``testcases/open_posix_testsuite/`` which is a well maintained
+fork of the Open POSIX testsuite project, that has been dead since 2005.
+
+We also have a number of directories with tests for more specific features, such
+as containers, etc.
+
+Runtest Files
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The list of tests to be executed is stored in runtest files under the
+``runtest/`` directory. The default set of runtest files to be executed is
+stored in ``scenario_groups/default``. When you add a test, you should add
+corresponding entries into some runtest file(s) as well.
+
+Each line of runtest file contains one test. The first item is the test name.
+All other items, separated by space will be executed as a command.
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+      shell_test01 echo "SUCCESS" | shell_pipe01.sh
+      splice02 splice02 -s 20
+
+Blank lines and lines starting with a ``#`` (comments) are ignored.
+
+Syscalls tests, placed under ``testcases/kernel/syscalls/``, use
+``runtest/syscalls`` file. For kernel related tests for memory management we
+have ``runtest/mm``, etc.
+
+.. note::
+
+      runtest files should have one entry per a test. Creating a
+      wrapper that runs all your tests and adding it as a single test
+      into runtest file is strongly discouraged.
+
+Datafiles
+---------
+
+If your test needs data files, these should be put into a subdirectory
+named ``datafiles`` and installed into the ``testcases/data/$TCID`` directory.
+This will require to add ``INSTALL_DIR := testcases/data/TCID`` into
+``datafiles/Makefile``.
+
+You can obtain path to datafiles via ``$TST_DATAROOT`` provided by ``test.sh``
+or via C function ``tst_dataroot()`` provided by libltp:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+      const char *dataroot = tst_dataroot();
+
+Datafiles can also be accessed as ``$LTPROOT/testcases/data/$TCID/...``,
+but ``$TST_DATAROOT`` and ``tst_dataroot()`` are preferred, as these can be used
+when running testcases directly in git tree as well as from install location.
+
+Subexecutables
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If your test needs to execute a binary, place it in the same directory of the
+testcase and name the binary with ``$TESTNAME_`` prefix, where ``$TESTNAME`` is
+the name of the test binary. Once the test is executed by the framework, the
+path to the directory with all LTP binaries is added to the ``$PATH`` and you
+can execute it via its name.
+
+.. note::
+
+      If you need to execute a test from the LTP tree, you can add ``PATH`` to
+      the current directory with ``PATH="$PATH:$PWD" ./foo01``.
+
+Test Contribution Checklist
+---------------------------
+
+#. Test compiles and it runs fine (check with ``-i 10`` and ``-i 0`` too)
+#. ``make check`` should not emit any warnings for the test you are working on
+   (hint: run it in the test's directory and/or use ``make check-$TCID``)
+#. The runtest entries are in place
+#. New test binaries are added into the corresponding ``.gitignore`` files
+#. Patches apply over the latest git
+
+About .gitignore files
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+There are numerous ``.gitignore`` files in the LTP tree. Usually, there is a
+``.gitignore`` file for a group of tests. The reason of this setup is simple:
+it's easier to maintain a ``.gitignore`` file per tests' directory, rather
+than having a single file in the project root directory. In this way, we don't
+have to update all the gitignore files when moving directories, and they get
+deleted automatically when a directory with tests is removed.
+
+Testing pre-release kernel features
+-----------------------------------
+
+Tests for features not yet in the mainline kernel release are accepted. However,
+they must be added only to the **staging** runtest file. Once a feature is part
+of the stable kernel ABI, the associated test must be moved out of staging.
+
