Maybe Maurizio already have it at hand?
I can try to setup a system with grub2+tpm to get the log with pcr 8 and
9 filled.

Missed this last paragraph.. but /sys/class/tpm/tpm0/ppi/version has
relation to the Physical Presence Interface version, which is the
communication interface between firmware and OS afaik, and doesn't
points to the TPM version: TPM2.0 may have PPI version 1.2 or 1.3.
