As a newbie with LTP I am still struggling to understand some things
like this one. How is possible to merge to master in order to review?

Again from my POV the description is more about what you should do as a
reviewer than how to get a patch merged.

I feel that this is more an overview and reminder of already
contributors. Not sure how helpful is it for new comers like myself
