Of course we have to *not* version also sphinx-rtd-theme, because it's release
is tight to sphinx version. That was obvious (2.0.0 requires sphinx < 8), but I
tried it in our readthedocs.org to verify it really fails.

IMHO it'd be better to keep sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme to these which are used
in readthedocs.org. Because that way we still use the same version (we control
the version used in readthedocs.org via os version used in .readthedocs.yml.
