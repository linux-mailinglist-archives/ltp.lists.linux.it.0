First, there are 7 FTP related tests:

testcases/network/tcp_cmds/ftp/ftp01.sh
testcases/network/stress/ftp/ftp-upload-stress02-rmt.sh
testcases/network/stress/ftp/ftp-upload-stress01-rmt.sh
testcases/network/stress/ftp/ftp-upload-stress.sh
testcases/network/stress/ftp/ftp-download-stress02-rmt.sh
testcases/network/stress/ftp/ftp-download-stress01-rmt.sh
testcases/network/stress/ftp/ftp-download-stress.sh

rmt files are using in ftp-upload-stress.sh and ftp-download-stress.sh. They are
part of runtest/net_stress.appl. Others tools/protocols for testing are SSH and DNS,
I wonder if we should get rid of whole tests in runtest/net_stress.appl.

Only ftp01.sh is converted to the new API, the rest is using the legacy API.
While it wouldn't be difficult to convert them, I wonder if it's really useful
for modern kernel testing. Is it really worth to have these tests as a smoke
tests?

ftp-download-stress.sh and ftp-upload-stress.sh have some vsftpd server setup.

Here is a description of some of the tests:

	ftp-download-stress01
		Verify the ftp server or the kernel is not down after a ftp client
		requests large data via IPv4/IPv6

	ftp-download-stress02
		Verify the ftp server or the kernel is not down after many ftp
		clients request data over IPv4/IPv6 asynchronously for a long time

	ftp-upload-stress01
		Verify the ftp server or the kernel is not down after a ftp client
		uploads a large data via IPv4/IPv6

	ftp-upload-stress02
		Verify the ftp server or the kernel is not down after many ftp clients
		uploads data over IPv4/IPv6 asynchronously for a long time

I doubt that FTP server would crash the kernel, IMHO it's more about testing the
FTP server itself.

Kind regards,
Petr
