I used that as an illustration since we're capping nearly all (regular)
uapi structures at that as a somewhat reasonable upper bound. If that's
smaller that's fine.

Sure, fine by me.

Sure, we do that already in some cases because we have use-cases for
that.

Ok.

For pidfs and nsfs it will definitely be the way we're doing it.
Especially with structures we definitely want to grow. I have zero
interest in spamming userspace with either a fragmented set of 100
ioctls that never give consistent information because they need to be
called in sequence nor constantly revised V2-100 ioctl commands that all
use a new structure with a fixed layout.

The fact that the ioctl api currently lacks validation is more testament
to how unspecified the requirements for ioctls and their encoding are
and we better fix that in general because like it or not we already have
quite a few size-versioned ioctls anyway. This is nothing we cannot fix.

Tell me what work you need and we'll do it.

The alternative I see is that I will start being very liberal in adding
extensible system calls for stuff such as pidfd_info() and ns_info()
instead of making them ioctls on the file where they belong.
