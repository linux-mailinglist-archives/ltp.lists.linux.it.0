Not just in the kernel, but also in user-space.  The kernel contacts
rpcbind to find how to talk to statd.  statd talks to rpcbind to tell it
how it where it can be reached.  As you say - it has been this way for
"ages".

So maybe the bug is that something creates a network namespace without
also creating a filesystem namespace.  Certainly the kernel allows this
as it should because the kernel doesn't set policy.
But using the freedom to create a setup that doesn't actually work is
foolish.  If ltp creates a network namespace without creating a matching
filesystem name space, and expects NFSv3 to work - then that is a bug in
ltp.

Now I agree that using path names seems not ideal in this case, and it
would be a valuable enhancement to make it easy to avoid that.  But it
is an enhancement, not a bugfix.

Surely the fix is to do something else, not just to do nothing :-)

There is good reason to use use AF_UNIX for the kernel to contact
rpcbind.

In fact the kernel has only been using AF_UNIX to contact rpcbind for
about 12 years.

Commit 7402ab19cdd5 ("SUNRPC: Use AF_LOCAL for rpcbind upcalls")
gives some of the reasons for the change.  They are still good reasons.

Fortunately Linux provides "abstract" AF_UNIX names, which provide all
the benefits that we want of AF_UNIX, but doesn't depend on the
filesystem and keeps the bindings private to the network namespace - the
best of both worlds.

To fully implement this we need changes to libtirpc and to the kernel.
Not big changes, but not entirely trivial either.

Check that commit for what can break.

For testing, you can change /usr/lib/rpcbind.sock to listen on
/run/NOT-rpcbind.sock instead. of /run/rpcbind.sock

It must listen on at least one AF_UNIX socket as you noted,
but it doesn't have to listen on one that any tool will talk to.  This
will cause all code (user-space and kernel) to fall-back on IPv6 or IPv4
to contact rpcbind.
So maybe you can work-around the bug in ltp that way.  You could even
just "rm -f /var/run/rpcbind.sock" after starting rpcbind, and before
running the test.

Meanwhile I'll post some patches which enhancements to the kernel and to
libtirpc to use abstract AF_UNIX socket when available.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
