I don't know why, but that was for sure discussed in some previous versions.
Or do you want to get back to it after this effort gets merged?

We usually prefer functions, which are more readable. But I'll comment that more
at the 4th patch.

I don't think either C++ templates for LTP would be a good idea.
The code is very simple to include any templating system.
Also testing (g)libc headers should be IMHO done with plain C.

Kind regards,
Petr
