Possibly it is only files that are not tracked due to .gitignore. At
least that is how I interpret the Git help. Either way it's not such a
concern due to the below.

Ah I think I see your concern now. It does not touch the directory
outside the container. It copies everything in first (IDK if it actually
copies the data if you are doing a local build).

Note that I tried using a .dockerignore to stop build artifacts being
copied, but it's not as rich as the .gitignore(s) we have sprinkled
throughout the LTP.

Yeah, I think it should be the default.
