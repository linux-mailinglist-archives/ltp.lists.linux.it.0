Cyril, maybe we should have kept the way to completely disable building metadata
until we actually use it (i.e. until runtest files are replaced).

OTOH this way give the change to (embedded) distros to fix host build setup
issues :). I was testing Buildroot last night and it has problems with build on
archs which have cross-compile flags (CFLAGS) incompatible with host flags
(HOST_CFLAGS). This might require deeper changes to introduce LTP host build
(Buildroot support host autotools builds, but LTP is not fully autootools
project - we use only autoconf).

Hard to help without seeing logs.

Kind regards,
