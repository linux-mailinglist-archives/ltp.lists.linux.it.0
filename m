Yes this seems simple and enough, implementing this in the v2
of this patch.

Yes, agree.
`man 2 mknod` doesn't say anything about the S_ISGID of the new node being
created, so in which cases new node should have S_ISGID bit set? 
IIUC, in the above kernel function inode_init_owner(), it is being set only if
new node is a directory?

(looking at mknod03|04|05|08, these tests somehow trying to  verify the 
S_ISGID bit of the newly created node)
