I was getting ahead of myself and thinking about using the C-api to keep track of creating sub-cgroups and all the state that comes with that. Which we wouldn't want to do for a shell utility because creation/cleanup of subgroups is for the test to take care of and

Yes; tests which require complicated hierarchies have to cleanup
themselves. I think it would be a waste of time to add a generic
sub-directory cleanup mechanism until we have a number of tests which
would benefit from it.

Especially because some controllers might place special restrictions on
directory and process manipulation. (cpuset for example?).

The daemons state would be tied to the test that's issuing commands to it.

And when tst_cgroup_cleanup() gets called it only cleans up its own test_dir and removes the ltp dir and unmounts the mount point if it was the first test to do it. So

I think maybe you are talking about two different things. However IMO
daemons should be avoided in general. There is no hard requirement here
to have a long running process.

This is where I believe Richard was mentioning passing the PID as "tst_cgroup cleanup --pid $MAIN_PID". Which if we wanted to use the C api for this we would have to

I suppose we also need to remember if the current test created the ltp
subdirectory or mounted any controllers.

We could do this by just printing the required command line options to
stdout when the utility exits. Then save this to a variable for the next
use.

Yes, sounds good.
