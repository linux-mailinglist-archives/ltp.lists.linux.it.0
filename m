FYI openQA has many multimachine tests.
Also in the openqa the multimachine tests are done exactly with localapi,
so basically semaphores.

Personally for development and testing of the ltp 2-hosts I used:
https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt
Yeah, terraform. I imagine hooking things up together so
that terraform-provider-libvirt provides VMs with needed IPs and what not,
and kirk connects to SUT over ssh and the ltp nfs tests simply run the
tests, should be simple exercise.

I do not see a problem with lhost being a driver for net/nfs tests run on 2
machines.
But if we see a need, we could also provide a sort of lock api, so nodes of
multimachine tests could be synchronized that way too.
I guess those approaches are complementary, not exclusive.
