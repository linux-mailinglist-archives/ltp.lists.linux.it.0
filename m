Hi Tim,

as Cyril noted, having kirk on the host you would need only LTX on the target
(SUT). That would avoid python on the target. LTX is very small binary (given
you compile whole LTP for target). Although running kirk on the target is
possible, there is not much benefit (one can just export LTPROOT, modify PATH
and run test manually).

I'm not trying to persuade you to take kirk (understand you have strong reasons
not to take it), just FYI some test in the future will need extra tooling (e.g.
support for reboot) and that functionality you either miss or will need to
implement in Fuego (also probably Cyril already noted).

Other thing is that we all invest time to implement our own tooling (IMHO waste
of time, there is a lot of code, not just run the tests, but dmesg, coredump,
restart SUT after failure, ...) instead of reusing at least a minimal subset
and slowly improve that for the benefit of all.

Also, the more we work with *any* shell implementation the more we see it's from
the long term perspective to avoid having even slightly complex tools in shell.
Simple C code avoids many problems in shell (we know POSIX shell syntax, but
there are subtle differences in each implementation which show later on).  At
certain point we even considered writing our minimal shell implementation to
avoid shell craziness (but then we just decided to write tests mostly in C).
Also some tests are buggy when written in shell (e.g.  cgroup tests).

Kind regards,
Petr
