I tried a quick experiment. Adding it to cgroup.subtree_control is not
enough. However adding a process to a cgroup where the controller is
enabled causes mount to fail with EBUSY. There could be other ways. I
would assume that sort of thing can change as well between kernel versions.

If we want to avoid attempting the mount then maybe even just scanning
cgroup.controllers is best. This is practically what we do in tst_cgroup
lib. However there is also just the option of not running the test on
systems where only V2 will be used. So this is just a minimal fix to
keep the test limping along until they are obsolete or rewritten
entirely.

Another option would be to split the tests into V1 only and everything
else. That would work for us if distros are practically stopping support for
V1 on newer versions. Then there is no need to make these tests detect
V2, we just don't run them on those systems.
