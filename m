Well, it depends on what functionality exactly you want to test... See
below.

So this will read the very same page in the page cache that mmap(2) has
been using for write. As such it isn't very interesting verification. I'd
at least use direct IO to verify the data is stored on disk now.

Overall this looks correct. But what this test really does is that it
verifies msync(2) is clearing dirty page bits. That is not very useful
verification from userspace point of view (as IMO it leans too much on
internal kernel implementation details). msync(2) is really a data
integrity operation so ideally its tests would verify data integrity
guarantees are met after a power failure - that is what userspace is
interested in. But probably these test are more within the realm of fstests
(where we do similar tests) as LTP lacks necessary infrastructure to do
this low-level filesystem manipulation so I guess what you have is fine.
