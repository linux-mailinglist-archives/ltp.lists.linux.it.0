I would suggest just using sync, but Petr originally suggested using a
wait loop. Then reported that the bug was still reproducible with the
loop:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/Y3s+Czg8sBsGYO+1@pevik/

Then said it wasn't reproducible. The problem is that if using a loop
doesn't solve it then possibly the VFAT meta-data doesn't get written to
disk in the absence of any pressure.

So instead I'd suggest resurrecting Petr's original patch or at least
his approach. If we merge that and still see failures then maybe it's
worth investigating more with tracing/debugging.
