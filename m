Try this:

diff --git a/testcases/realtime/func/sched_football/sched_football.c b/testcases/realtime/func/sched_football/sched_football.c
index 0617bdb87..0d64210b0 100644
--- a/testcases/realtime/func/sched_football/sched_football.c
+++ b/testcases/realtime/func/sched_football/sched_football.c
@@ -115,8 +115,8 @@ void referee(int game_length)
        now = start;
 
        /* Start the game! */
-       tst_atomic_store(0, &the_ball);
        pthread_barrier_wait(&start_barrier);
+       tst_atomic_store(0, &the_ball);
        atrace_marker_write("sched_football", "Game_started!");


We have to be sure that the defense has started before we clear the
ball. Previously we had the loop that waited for the players to be ready
before we called referee() function so all the players were ready when
we cleared it.
