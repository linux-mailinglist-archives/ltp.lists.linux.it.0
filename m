UCLINUX is dead and it's support has been removed from LTP.

Although Documentation/admin-guide/mm/nommu-mmap.rst still exists in
kernel tree, there is nobody really using it.

--------------
---- Intro ---
--------------
-
-Linux running on processors without a memory management unit place certain
-restrictions on the userspace programs.  Here we will provide some guidelines
-for people who are not familiar with such systems.
-
-If you are not familiar with virtual memory, you might want to review some
-background such as:
-	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Memory
-	/usr/src/linux/Documentation/nommu-mmap.txt
-
-----------------------------
---- No memory protection ---
-----------------------------
-
-By virtue of every process getting its own virtual memory space, applications
-are protected from each other.  So a bad memory access in one will not affect
-the memory of another.  When processors forgo virtual memory, they typically
-do not add memory protection back in to the hardware.  There are one or two
-exceptions to this rule, but for now, we'll assume no one supports it.
-
-In practical terms, this means you cannot dereference bad pointers directly
-and expect the kernel to catch and kill your application.  However, you can
-expect the kernel to catch some bad pointers when given to system calls.
-
-For example, this will "work" in the sense that no signal will be sent:
-	char *foo = NULL;
-	foo[0] = 'a';
-	foo[1] = 'b';
-
-However, the kernel should return errors when using "standard" bad pointers
-with system calls.  Such as:
-	char *foo = NULL;
-	write(1, foo, 10);
-	-> kernel will return EFAULT or similar
-The other bad pointer you can rely on in your tests is -1:
-	char *foo = (void *)-1;
-	read(0, foo, 10);
-	-> kernel will return EFAULT or similar
-
-Otherwise, no bad pointer may reliably be tested, either directly or
-indirectly via the kernel.  This tends to be a large part of the UCLINUX
-ifdef code that shows up in LTP.
-
-----------------
---- No forks ---
-----------------
-
-The ubiquitous fork() function relies completely on the Copy On Write (COW)
-functionality provided by virtual memory to share pages between processes.
-Since this isn't feasible without virtual memory, there is no fork() function.
-You will either get a linker error (undefined reference to fork) or you will
-get a runtime failure of ENOSYS.
-
-Typically, fork() is used for very few programming paradigms:
-	- daemonization
-	- run a program
-	- parallelism
-
-For the daemonization functionality, simply use the daemon() function.  This
-works under both MMU and NOMMU systems.
-
-To run a program, simply use vfork() followed by an exec-style function.
-And change the error handler in the child from exit() to _exit().  This too
-works under both MMU and NOMMU systems.  But be aware of vfork() semantics --
-since the parent and child share the same memory process, the child has to be
-careful in what it does.  This is why the recommended construct is simply:
-	pid_t child = vfork();
-	if (vfork == 0)
-		_exit(execl(....));
-
-For parallelism where processes use IPC to work together, you have to options,
-neither of which are easy.  You can rewrite to use threads, or you can re-exec
-yourself with special flags to pass along updated runtime state.  This is what
-the self_exec() helper function in LTP is designed for.
-
--------------------------
---- No overcommitting ---
--------------------------
-
-Virtual memory allows people to do malloc(128MiB) and get back a buffer that
-big.  But that buffer is only of virtual memory, not physical.  On a NOMMU
-system, the memory comes immediately from physical memory and takes it away
-from anyone else.
-
-Avoid large mallocs.
-
----------------------
---- Fragmentation ---
----------------------
-
-On a MMU system, when physical memory gets fragmented, things slow down.  But
-they keep working.  This is because every new process gets a clean virtual
-memory address space.  While processes can fragment their own virtual address
-space, this usually takes quite a long time and a lot of effort, so generally
-it is not a problem people hit.
-
-On a NOMMU system, when physical memory gets fragmented, access to large
-contiguous blocks becomes unavailable which means requests fail.  Even if your
-system has 40MiB _total_ free, the largest contiguous block might only be 1MiB
-which means that allocations larger than that will always fail.
-
-Break up your large memory allocations when possible.  Generally speaking,
-single allocations under 2MiB aren't a problem.
-
------------------
---- No paging ---
------------------
-
-No virtual memory means you can't mmap() a file and only have the pages read in
-(paged) on the fly.  So if you use mmap() on a file, the kernel must allocate
-memory for it and read in all the contents immediately.
-
----------------------
---- No swap space ---
----------------------
-
-See the "No paging" section above.  For the same reason, there is no support
-for swap partitions.  Plus, nommu typically means embedded which means flash
-based storage which means limited storage space and limited number of times
-you can write it.
-
--------------------------
---- No dynamic stacks ---
--------------------------
-
-No virtual memory means that applications can't all have their stacks at the
-top of memory and allowed to grown "indefinitely" downwards.  Stack space is
-fixed at process creation time (when it is first executed) and cannot grow.
-While the fixed size may be increased, it's best to avoid stack pressure in
-the first place.
-
-Avoid the alloca() function and use malloc()/free() instead.
-
-Avoid declaring large buffers on the stack.  Some people like to do things
-such as:
-	char buf[PATH_MAX];
-This will most likely smash the stack on nommu systems !  Use global variables
-(the bss), or use malloc()/free() type functions.
-
--------------------------------
---- No dynamic data segment ---
--------------------------------
-
-No virtual memory means that mappings cannot arbitrarily be extended.  Another
-process might have its own mapping right after yours!  This is where the brk()
-and sbrk() functions come into play.  These are most often used to dynamically
-increase the heap space via the C library, but a few people use these manually.
-
-Best if you simply avoid them, and if you're writing tests to exercise these
-functions specifically, make them nops/XFAIL for nommu systems.
-
--------------------------------
---- Limited shared mappings ---
--------------------------------
-
-No virtual memory means files cannot be mmapped in and have writes to it
-written back out to disk on the fly.  So you cannot use MAP_SHARED when
-mmapping a file.
-
--------------------------
---- No fixed mappings ---
--------------------------
-
-The MAP_FIXED option to mmap() is not supported.  It doesn't even really work
-all that well under MMU systems.
-
-Best if you simply avoid it, and if you're writing tests to exercise this
-option specifically, make them nops/XFAIL for nommu systems.
