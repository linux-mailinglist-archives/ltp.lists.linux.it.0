What I'm thinking about is to replace the tst_rhost_run() with a
synchronization between multiple tests scripts. With that a script can
wait for some kind of event instead of running the code itself.

It would be far more flexible approach than what we have now. With that
we could easily scale to tests with three or more machines that are
impossible to implement at the moment. But of course unless we actually
write a proof of a concept we will not be able fully understand if this
concept is going to be better or not.

It should be possible to design the system so that tests can be executed
with a simpler solution than kirk.

Also it's not as standalone as you may think. You need to 1) start two
machines and manually install LTP there 2) write the IP addresses into
the configuration and only once that is done you can execute tests on
two machines.

I think that this is because our multimachine design is not as easy to
use as it should be.
