Hi Cyril,

Thanks, very nice doc!
Reviewed-by: Petr Vorel <pvorel@suse.cz>

Few more style/typo/grammar notes below. Found by chatgpt, I picked just few of
them which looked to me significant (obviously AI would improve the style, but
lets ignore that).  Feel free to ignore, otherwise just amend before merge.
Labels "typo:" or "grammar:" should probably be fixed.

AI also suggests to use often articles, e.g. for "parent" and "child" (mostly "the",
sometimes "a"), but let's ignore that.
