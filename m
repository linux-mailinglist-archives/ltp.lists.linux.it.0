I don't expect a lot of nommu users are aware you ever _could_ run LTP on nommu.

But I'd like to get nommu more regularly supported. You _should_ be able to
build a musl-linux userspace with busybox or toybox and be able to build a
recognizable system (even an alpine-alike) which could then get the basic
plumbing regression tested on qemu even without access to nommu hardware.

I'm writing a bash-compatible shell, which (thanks to Elliott forwarding
questions) has involved surprisingly long threads with the bash maintainer about
weird corner cases neither the man page nor my testing made clear:

http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2023-July/029631.html

(Alas I try NOT to involve him because when I bring stuff up he keeps FIXING
BASH which from my point of view just makes it a moving target...)

Anyway, running the shell API on nommu doesn't seem out of the question, but
probably not any time soon. (The fact the shell isn't finished yet is one of the
big REASONS I haven't got enough time to take on LTP. That and I haven't started
writing "awk" and "make" yet". And I need to cycle back to
https://landley.net/notes-2023.html#12-10-2023 . And after that debian, ala
https://peertube.debian.social/w/chzkKrMvEczG7qQyjbMKPr and
https://peertube.debian.social/w/45XroN9CnbYLNLKQH3GD9F . And follow up on
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/coreutils/2023-08/msg00009.html . And...)

safe_fork(), safe_clone(), fork_testrun()...

Library meaning... libc? Or does LTP have a library?

My standard questions are "what does success look like" and "how do I reproduce
the problem".

For the first: if there previously was nommu support in LTP, what's the last
version that's known to work? Is there an existing build/test setup that can be
reproduced?

For the second... If I try to run LTP on sh2eb (my current nommu test board)
with the current LTP... do I get a build break? Additional test failures at
runtime? You talk about "removing nommu support", but... what's the current
status? (A subset of tests still use the old api...?)

Yes I need to read https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/C-Test-API but
I also need to know how to build LTP from source. I'm looking at the README's
list of "autoconf, automake, m4, pkgconf / pkg-config" and wincing
significantly. (What does gnu/autoconf DO here? Disable tests? I never
understand why anybody uses that giant hairball of complexity. Half of cross
compiling is figuring out how to lie to autoconf, and my normal workaround for
that is to bootstrap a target system and build natively, but while I've gotten
gcc to run natively on nommu systems, I never _tried_ gnu/autoconf.
Bootstrapping some subset of LFS on a nommu system so it has the dependencies
LFS needs to natively build seems like the long way 'round...

(I am not the right guy for "make it work the easy way". I am the guy who will
step on every land mine between here and there. I code by debugging an empty
screen. If I don't start from "known working" setup... it would take a while.)
