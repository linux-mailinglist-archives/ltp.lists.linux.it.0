Thanks!

Good to know. Also, we have new feature in shell API: $TST_ALL_FILESYSTEMS (it
has been for long time for C API as .all_filesystems, which loops the test over
various filesystems: ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, exfat, ntfs, tmpfs.
Test therefore takes much longer, but it's worth for tests which can behave
differently on various filesystems. I suppose IMA does not need it, right?

Correct measurement outside of the loop device? I.e. something in $TST_TMPDIR?
(i.e. /tmp/foo - test unique working directory, $TST_MNTPOINT is mounted on
/tmp/foo/mntpoint, so that we still have working place outside mounted loop device).
Do you mean trying to measure something what expects to fail?

OK not quiting whole test with TBROK, but add TWARN (test continue, but later
exits with non-zero).

Thanks a lot for testing. I give it try today and merge it today or early next
week.
