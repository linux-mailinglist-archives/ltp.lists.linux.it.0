Hi Andrea,

Thanks!

LGTM, a few notes below.

Most important is switch gmane to lore. With that:

Maybe mention here https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/issues ?
(i.e. Fixing bugs in the tests?)

I'm not sure if easyhacks are still relevant (atm 8 tasks):

(gmane.org is gone), please use lore:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-api/

NOTE kernel community switched even lkml.org to lore (they prefer it as it's run
by Linux Foundation instead of 3rd party):

wc -l $(git grep 'include "test\.h"' testcases/ | cut -d: -f1) | sort -g

* there are other tests than in testcases/kernel/
* git grep is faster (we expect people working with git clone)

+1 for pointing out shell is problematic and discourage users to write new
tests. Maybe mention also a shell loader?

I would say the problem is with unreliability/instability of shell
implementation (even we use C parts glued by shell it's not enough). Specially
cgroup related tests should be all rewritten in C as shell does not add enough
control + race condition.

I remember Wei converted recently test_6 to cpuset02.c and that's it. And we
~300 tests (both old and new API):

$ git grep -l -e '^\. .*_lib\.sh' -e '^\. .*test.sh' |wc -l
294

The reality is that we convert most of them to shell loader (way less work, also
for many tests e.g. in testcases/{commands,network}/ it could be sufficient
enough).

Kind regards,
Petr
