Hi!

No idea about these choices, there is a lot of historicall mess in there
feel free to clean things up.

Sure.

Another option would be /opt/open_posix_testsuite/ since apart from
being in the LTP git repository these are not integrated with the rest
of the LTP at all.

Sounds good.

This is in the long term plan for the new LTP testrunner, hopefully we
will have something by the end of the year.
