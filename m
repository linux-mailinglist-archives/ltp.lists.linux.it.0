+ *
+ * @TINFO: Prints an additional information, it does not change the test result

+ * @TCONF: Reports unsupported configuration. When tests produce this result at

+ *
+ * @TERRNO: Combine bitwise with result flags to append errno to the output message.
+ *
+ * @TTERRNO: Combine bitwise with result flags to append error from TST_ERR to

+ *                     Testcases that modify system wallclock use this to

+ *                    is enabled.
+ *

+ * @hugepages: An interface to reserve hugepages prior running the test.
+ *             Request how many hugepages should be reserved in the global

+ *             or not, i.e. if test should exit with TCONF if the requested
+ *             amount of hugepages cannot be reserved. If TST_REQUEST is set
+ *             the library will try it's best to reserve the hugepages and

+ *               and tst_taint_check() at the end of the test. If all_filesystems
+ *               is set taint check will be performed after each iteration and
+ *               testing will be terminated by TBROK if taint is detected.
+ *
+ * @test_variants: If set denotes number of test variant, the test is executed
+ *                 variants times each time with tst_variant set to different
+ *                 number. This allows us to run the same test for different
+ *                 settings. The intended use is to test different syscall
+ *                 wrappers/variants but the API is generic and does not limit
+ *                 usage in any way.
+ *
+ * @dev_min_size: A minimal device size in megabytes.
+ *
+ * @dev_fs_type: If set overrides the default file system type for the device and
+ *               sets the tst_device.fs_type.
+ *
+ * @dev_fs_opts: A NULL terminated array of options passed to mkfs in the case
+ *               of 'tst_test.format_device'. These options are passed to mkfs
+ *               before the device path.
+ *
+ * @dev_extra_opts: A NULL terminated array of extra options passed to mkfs in
+ *                  the case of 'tst_test.format_device'. Extra options are
+ *                  passed to mkfs after the device path. Commonly the option
+ *                  after mkfs is the number of blocks and can be used to limit
+ *                  the file system not to use the whole block device.
+ *
+ * @mntpoint: A mount point where the test library mounts requested file system.
+ *            The directory is created by the library, the test must not create
+ *            it itself.
+ *
+ * @mnt_flags: MS_* flags passed to mount(2) when the test library mounts a
+ *             device in the case of 'tst_test.mount_device'.
+ *
+ * @mnt_data: The data passed to mount(2) when the test library mounts a device
+ *            in the case of 'tst_test.mount_device'.
+ *
+ * @max_runtime: Maximal test runtime in seconds. Any test that runs for more
+ *               than a second or two should set this and also use
+ *               tst_remaining_runtime() to exit when runtime was used up.
+ *               Tests may finish sooner, for example if requested number of
+ *               iterations was reached before the runtime runs out. If test
+ *               runtime cannot be know in advance it should be set to
+ *               TST_UNLIMITED_RUNTIME.
+ *
+ * @setup: Setup callback is called once at the start of the test in order to
+ *         prepare the test environment.
+ *
+ * @cleanup: Cleanup callback is either called at the end of the test, or in a
+ *           case that tst_brk() was called. That means that cleanup must be
+ *           able to handle all possible states the test can be in. This
+ *           usually means that we have to check if file descriptor was opened
+ *           before we attempt to close it, etc.
+ *
+ *
+ * @test: A main test function, only one of the tst_test.test and test_all can
+ *        be set. When this function is set the tst_test.tcnt must be set to a
+ *        positive integer and this function will be executed tcnt times
+ *        during a single test iteration. May be executed several times if test
+ *        was passed '-i' or '-d' command line parameters.
+ *
+ * @test_all: A main test function, only one of the tst_test.test and test_all
+ *            can be set. May be executed several times if test was passed '-i'
+ *            or '-d' command line parameters.
+ *
+ * @resource_files: A NULL terminated array of filenames that will be copied
+ *                  to the test temporary directory from the LTP datafiles
+ *                  directory.
+ *
+ * @needs_drivers: A NULL terminated array of kernel modules required to run
+ *                 the test. The module has to be build in or present in order
+ *                 for the test to run.
+ *
+ * @save_restore: A {} terminated array of /proc or /sys files that should
+ *                saved at the start of the test and restored at the end. See
+ *                tst_sys_conf_save() and struct tst_path_val for details.
+ *
+ * @ulimit: A {} terminated array of process limits RLIMIT_* to be adjusted for
+ *          the test.
+ *
+ * @needs_kconfigs: A NULL terminated array of kernel config options that are
+ *                  required for the test. All strings in the array have to be
+ *                  evaluated to true for the test to run. Boolean operators
+ *                  and parenthesis are supported, e.g.
+ *                  "CONFIG_X86_INTEL_UMIP=y | CONFIG_X86_UIMP=y" is evaluated
+ *                  to true if at least one of the options is present.
+ *
+ * @bufs: A description of guarded buffers to be allocated for the test. Guarded
+ *        buffers are buffers with poisoned page allocated right before the start
+ *        of the buffer and canary right after the end of the buffer. See
+ *        struct tst_buffers and tst_buffer_alloc() for details.
+ *
+ * @caps: A {} terminated array of capabilities to change before the start of
+ *        the test. See struct tst_cap and tst_cap_setup() for details.
+ *
+ * @tags: A {} terminated array of test tags. See struct tst_tag for details.
+ *
+ * @needs_cmds: A NULL terminated array of commands required for the test to run.
+ *
+ * @needs_cgroup_ver: If set the test will run only if the specified cgroup
+ *                    version is present on the system.
+ *
+ * @needs_cgroup_ctrls: List of cgroup controllers the test needs to run.
