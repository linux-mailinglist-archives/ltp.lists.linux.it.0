While we have added a documentation on supported kernels, compilers, how
to compile and run LTP etc. Some kind of a comprehensive guide for
people new to LTP and kernel testing was missing. This patch adds a
short guide that tries to explain some of the pitfalls of kernel
testing. Feel free to point out what is missing and suggest additional
chapters.

+Testers guide to the Linux test project
+=======================================
+
+While we try to make LTP work out of the box as much as possible there are
+still many things that testers need to consider before the actual testing
+starts. It's advisable to make a test plans in order to asses and formalize the
+expected test coverage or even just sit down for a while and consider different
+aspects of the problem at hand.
+
+
+Is testing even required?
+-------------------------
+
+Sometimes people tend to make an argument that there is no need to test the
+Linux kernel because it's heavily tested in upstream and hence very stable.
+That may be true, or at least one can say that upstream releases are not
+terribly unstable.
+
+However that argument holds only as long as you take the upstream sources
+verbatim, i.e. without any modifications and that includes taking the default
+.config optioins too. Once you stray away from what you consider the stable
+upstream source you introduce diffencies in behavior, possible bugs and
+problems into your codebase. That applies to patch backports too, it's quite
+easy to miss pre-requisites when backporting patches which may result in all
+kinds of breakages.
+
+
+Multi dimensionality
+--------------------
+
+First of all kernel testing is a multi dimensional problem, just compiling and
+running LTP will give you some coverage but very likely not enough. There are
+several big gaps that may be easily missed.
+
+For example 64bit Linux kernel provides compatibility layer for 32bit
+applications which code quality is usually a bit worse than the 64bit ABI.
+Hence recompiling LTP with -m32 in compiler flags and runnig both 64bit and
+32bit test binaries is a good start. If you try to make an argument that your
+application does not need 32bit support it's better to disable the compat layer
+completely since it's possible source of security bugs.
+
+Another dimension is the number of architectures you need to test, for a
+general distribution testing you may end up with a couple of them. Different
+architectures have different platform code as well as differencies in memory
+orderings, etc. that all means that running tests on one architecture out of
+several will give you incomplete coverage.
+
+You also have to decide if you are going to run tests in virtual machine e.g.
+qemu-kvm, on bare metal or both. Testing in virtual machine will give you about
+90% of the coverage for bare metal and vice versa.
+
+There are other options worth of consideration too, Linux kernel has many
+debugging options that are usually disabled on runtime since they incur
+singificant performance penalty. Having a few more LTP testruns with different
+debug options enabled e.g. KASAN may help catch bugs before they materialize in
+production.
+
+In practice your test matrix may easily explode and you may end up with dozens
+of differently configured testruns based on different considerations. The hard
+taks at hand is not to have too many since computing power is not an infinite
+resource and does not scale that easily. If you managed to read up to this
+point "Don't Panic" things are almost never as bad as they may seem at first
+glance.
+
+It's a good idea to start small with an evironment that models your production.
+Once that works well you can try different configurations. Select a few
+interesting ones and run them for some time in order to get an idea of their
+usefulness. If you are feeling adventurous you may try to measure and compare
+actual test coverage with one of the tools such as lcov. If you do so do not
+fall into a trap of attempting to have 100% line coverage. Having 100% of lines
+executed during the test does not mean that your test coverage is 100%. Good
+tests validate much more than just how much code from the tested binary was
+executed.
+
+You may need to sacrifice some coverage in order to match the tests runtime to
+the available computing power. When doing so Pareto principle is your friend.
+
+
+Test scope
+----------
+
+So far we were talking about a code coverage from a point of maximizing test
+coverage while keeping our test matrix as small as poissible. While that is a
+noble goal it's not the universal holy grail of testing. Different use cases
+have different considerations and scope. For a testing before the final release
+such testing is very desirable, however for a continuous integration or smoke
+testing the main requirement is that feedback loops are as short as possible.
+
+When a developer changes the kernel and submits the changes to be merged it's
+desirable to run some tests. Again the hard question is which tests. If we run
+all possible tests in all possible combinations it may take a day or two and
+the developer will move to a diffrent tasks before the tests have a chance to
+finish. If you multiply that by a number of developers in the team you may end
+up in a situation where a developer will retire before tests for his patch may
+have chance to finish.
+
+In this case careful selection of tests is even more important. Having less is
+more in this context. One of the first ideas for CI is to skip tests that run
+for more than a second or so, happily this can be easily done with kirk. In the
+future we may want to explore some heuristics that would map the code changes
+in kernel into a subset of tests, which would allow for a very quick feedback.
+
+
+Debugging test failures
+-----------------------
+
+You may think that you will enjoy some rest once you have your test matrix
+ready and your tests are running. Unfortunatelly that's where the actual work
+starts. Debugging test failures is probably the hardest part of the testing
+process. In some cases failures are easily reproducible and it's not that hard
+to locate the bug, either in the test or in the kernel itself. There are
+however, quite common, cases where the test failure reproduces only in 10% or
+even 1% of the test runs. That does not mean that there is no bug, that usually
+means that the bug depends on more prerequisities that have to manifest at the
+right time in order to trigger the failure. Sadly for modern systems that are
+asynchronous in nature such bugs are more and more common.
+
+The debugging process itself is not complicated at its nature. You have to
+attempt to undestand the failure by checking the logs, reading the source code,
+debugging with strace, gdb, etc. Then form a hypotesis and either prove or
+disprove it. Rinse and repeat until you end up with a clear description of what
+went wrong. Hopefully you will manage to find the root cause but you should not
+be discouraged if you do not. Debugging kernel bugs takes a lot of experience
+and skill one cay say as much as is needed write the kernel code.
+
+
+Happy testing!
