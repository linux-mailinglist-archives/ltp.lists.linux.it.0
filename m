Yes, that's job of the framework executor (kirk, openQA, TuxMake, Fuego, Lava,
etc).

Yes, but when there is some bug which needs to be bisected, the fastest approach
for network tests is to run with rapido over netns. New approach should keep
support for netns and real host. Of course real communication over network is
not the same as using netns, but quite a lot of bugs can be caught this way.

I'm not saying that there is not a requirement for 3+ machines tests just
because I don't see it :). But it would be kind of some special tests
(normally stressing a server is kind of test scenario for multi machine
tests).

And the reason why I'm asking question "do we need it?" is that I know how many
tests we have to rewrite (+ generally how much of LTP rewrite is unfinished,
including readthedoc migration).

Kind regards,
Petr
