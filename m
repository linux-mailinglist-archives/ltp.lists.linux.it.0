Sigh, I'm not sure we can ever make this work reliably.

Well, this is right but there's also the while ((freed >> shift++) > 1)
loop in drop_slab() which should generally make us loop as long as there's
something to reclaim. But yes, if in theory the only thing we can reclaim
is the child dentry in the first round, then what you suggest may happen.

OK, I'm willing to give this one last try. If it doesn't work out, I'd just
drop these tests until we can find a more reliable way of testing this.
