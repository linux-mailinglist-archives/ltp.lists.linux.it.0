Yes indeed, reasoning about your feedback on this I think the issue
really is different from what I thought (my bad): it is the final
SAFE_UMOUNT in the cleanup function that fails really because the
tst_is_mounted() that protects it is based on a simnple strstr() on
/proc/mounts/ and the directory names used are too much simple ("A")
so it is sufficient to have some unrelated mountpoint like
"/mnt/this_is_Another_mnt" to fool tst_is_mounted and make it think
our "A" still needs to be removed.

This also would explin why this bug has not been noticed elsewhere...
...it depends on your final running environment. (i.e. mountpoints)

Using a bit more peculiar names like to __DIR_A __DIR_B solves for me
indeed:

Agreed that the failure was elsewhere as above mentioned, so I will
keep the final SAFE_UMOUNT and just change the dir names and let the
cleanups remove what remains to be removed (e.g. in case of error)

Cristian
