Hi Richard and Li,

Hmm, why do we need that utility as a daemon in the background?
> Isn't it easier to execute a binary utility to get the CGroup path

was getting ahead of myself and thinking about using the C-api to keep
track of creating sub-cgroups and all the state that comes with that. Which
we wouldn't want to do for a shell utility because creation/cleanup of
subgroups is for the test to take care of and that is more trivial in a
shell environment.

like "controller_mount_point/ltp/test-$PID" where every test shares the
mount_point and ltp dir. And when tst_cgroup_cleanup() gets called it only
cleans up its own test_dir and removes the ltp dir and unmounts the mount
point if it was the first test to do it. So none of the tests should be
touching each other's directories and so what you're describing should
already be taken care of. Maybe I'm not understanding you correctly.

I think the only problem with the binary utility approach where we rescan
every time we execute it is that
1) The test-$PID dir that the test would be created with the PID of the
program which if we were executing the utility could be different between
calls. This could be easily solved by adding an arg to tst_cgroup_opts for
a specific PID, which would be the test that is calling it.
2) We lose the reference between calls to the root->test_dir that is filled
in when we call tst_cgroup_require(), which is what does the cleanup of the
test specific dir. This is where I believe Richard was mentioning passing
the PID as "tst_cgroup cleanup --pid $MAIN_PID". Which if we wanted to use
the C api for this we would have to expose it to knowing about specific
PIDs? Or for the root->test_dir to be reset somewhere?

Let me know if this makes sense and what you think about it, I might be
getting confused somewhere. But if I understand you correctly I believe
that the binary utility approach where we rescan and call
tst_cgroup_require() or tst_cgroup_cleanup() is a good approach.

Best,
- Luke
