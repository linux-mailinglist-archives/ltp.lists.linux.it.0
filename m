Why not skip to making them all TINFO?

It's undefined what action will result from MADV_WILLNEED. If it were
better for performance *not* to read in pages, then it would be valid
for the kernel to ignore it.

Yang Xu added a tag for a perf regression that it could
reproduce. However looking at the kernel commit this was first found by
stress-ng.

commit 66383800df9cbdbf3b0c34d5a51bf35bcdb72fd2
Author: Matthew Wilcox (Oracle) <willy@infradead.org>

    mm: fix madvise WILLNEED performance problem

    The calculation of the end page index was incorrect, leading to a
    regression of 70% when running stress-ng.

    With this fix, we instead see a performance improvement of 3%

I found a bug with this test, but it was causing an Oops. It wouldn't
matter if the test printed pass or fail.

So I think we are wasting our time by constantly tweaking this test.
