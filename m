Nice work, thanks for doing this!
Few spell checker issues and style below.
I'd slightly prefer avoiding "I" (first-person) style, i.e. use impersonal
language / passive (it's not a blog post but official document), but it's up to
you.

Maybe mention some functions, e.g. TST_CHECKPOINT_WAIT()? You could link the

:c:func:`TST_CHECKPOINT_WAIT()`
