+Ground Rules
+============
+
+Do not work around kernel bugs
+------------------------------
+
+We have decided what we will not work around bugs in upstream LTP sources. If a
+test fails on your system for a good reason, e.g. patch wasn't backported and
+the bug is present, work around for this will not be accepted upstream. The
+main reason for this decision is that this masks the failure for everyone else.
+
+
+Do not synchronize by sleep
+---------------------------
+
+Why is sleep in tests bad then?
+```````````````````````````````
+
+The first problem is that it will likely introduce very rare test failures,
+that means somebody has to spend time looking into these, which is a wasted
+effort. Nobody likes tests that will fail rarely for no good reason. Even more
+so you cannot run such tests with a background load to ensure that everything
+works correctly on a busy system, because that will increase the likehood of a
+failure.
+
+The second problem is that this wastes resources and slows down a test run. If
+you think that adding a sleep to a test is not a big deal, lets have a look at
+the bigger perspective. There is about 1600 syscall tests in Linux Test
+Project, if 7.5% of them would sleep just for one second, we would end up with
+two minutes of wasted time per testrun. In practice most of the test, that
+historically misused sleep for synchronization, waited for much longer just to
+be sure that things will works even on slower hardware. With sleeps between 2
+and 5 seconds that puts us somewhere between 4 and 10 minutes which is between
+13% and 33% of the syscall runtime on an outdated thinkpad, where the run
+finishes in a bit less than half an hour. It's even worse on newer hardware,
+because this slowdown will not change no matter how fast your machine is, which
+is maybe the reason why this was acceptable twenty years ago but it's not now.
+
+
+What to do instead?
+```````````````````
+
+Use proper synchronization.
+
+There are different problems and different solutions. Most often test needs to
+synchronize between child and parent proces.
+
+The easiest case is that parent needs to wait for a child to finish, that can
+be fixed just be adding a :man2:`waitpid` in the parent which ensures that child is
+finished before parent runs.
+
+Commonly child has to execute certain piece of code before parent can continue.
+For that LTP library implements checkpoints with simple
+:c:func:`TST_CHECKPOINT_WAIT()` and :c:func:`TST_CHECKPOINT_WAKE()` functions based
+on futexes on a piece of shared memory set up by the test library.
+
+Another common case is where child must sleep in a syscall before parent can
+continue, for which we have a :c:func:`TST_PROCESS_STATE_WAIT()` helper that
+polls `/proc/$PID/stat`.
+
+Less often test needs to wait for an action that is done asynchronously, or a
+kernel resource deallocation is deferred to a later time. In such cases the
+best we can do is to poll. In LTP we ended up with a macro that polls by
+calling a piece of code in a loop with exponentially increasing sleeps between
+retries until it succeeds. Which means that instead of sleeping for a maximal
+time event can possibly take the sleep is capped by twice of the optimal
+sleeping time while we avoid polling too aggressively.
+
+
+Use runtime checks for kernel features
+======================================
+
+What is and what isn't supported by kernel is determined by the version
+and configuration of the kernel the systems is currently running on.
+That especially means that any checks done during the compilation cannot
+be used to assume features supported by the kernel the tests end up
+running on. The compile time checks, done by configure script, are only
+useful for enabling fallback kernel API definitions when missing, as we
+do in lapi/ directory.
+
+
+Kernel features and RCs
+=======================
+
+LTP tests or fixes for kernel changes that were not released yet can be posted
+to the LTP list for a review but will not be be accepted until respective
+kernel changes are released. Review of such changes is also considered to be
+lower priority than rest of the changes. This is because kernel changes
+especially in the early RC phase are volatile and could be changed or reverted.
