I suppose it would not hurt to add "to your local copy of the master
branch". It's only a few more words that would clean it up (IMO). If
that doesn't make sense then you will have to do a search or ask someone
because this document can't be too long.

Perhaps we are not doing a good job of marketing patch review in this
document, but it is probably also outside the scope of this document.

Yup, there is a long tutorial which explains in depth a lot of stuff and
this could be expanded, but I don't have time for that right now.
