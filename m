My one question would be if we would want this daemon to run as a test
suite utility, like it seems you are suggesting, or as a per process
utility.

The nice part of having a daemon that we could fork off for every test that
uses it would be that the cleanup / tracking of sub-groups would get
cleaned up in the normal way when we want to close the daemon and just call
tst_cgroup_cleanup(). The daemons state would be tied to the test that's
issuing commands to it. We could also send out the commands via a shared
buffer or pipe that we read and write to.

But is a daemon per test (that uses the cgroup shell api) overkill? It
seems it would spare us from having to track the test PID to sub-hierarchy
like you were mentioning. Or maybe there are some other drawbacks to the
per-test daemon idea that I'm not seeing?

Looking forward to hearing what you think.
