Yes. Although we could add "next" and "rc" flags to tst_test (or
similar). Then require an environment variable to be set (or check the
kernel version) otherwise the test will return TCONF.

For LTP releases we just need to check if the flags are still needed or
if the feature has been merged. The metadata parser can generate a list
of tests to check.

This seems like quite little work to me. In fact we don't even have to
implement it until someone wants it. We can just add it to the policy.

> If yes, how would you phrase it (do you want to add / change

Something like:

"Tests for new functionality should only be added to the LTP once they
are part of the stable kernel ABI. This happens when a feature is
included in a final kernel release. Not during the RC phase where they
can still be removed and, for example, the syscall numbers reused.

This allows stable LTP releases to be taken directly from Git HEAD at
any time we are ready. Without needing to remove commits for unstable
feature tests or synchronise with the kernel releases.

Alternatively if someone is very motivated to add tests for linux-next
or the RC phase. We can add flags to tst_test which will prevent these
tests being run under normal circumstances. Meaning the releases are
unaffected."

I'd happily accept tests for things going into linux-next if there are
people willing to write them and they do not "throw them over the
wall and run".
