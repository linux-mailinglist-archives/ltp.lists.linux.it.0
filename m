Perhaps just

3. Keep the code as simple as possibe, but no simpler

This is possibly paraphrasing Einstein:
https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/


NOTE: I think future proofing is actually very dangerous. What I
      probably meant was

      3. Keep the code as simple as possible, while maintaining optionality,
         but if there appears to be a disproportionate increase in complexity
         for an increase in optionality then simplicity takes priority because
         identifying relevant optionality is hard.

      but "optionality" does not have a nice dictionary definition. I guess
      you could substitute it with "freedom". In any case it's not something I
      would want to write in documentation. There is no easy way to
      express it.

Indeed the address sanitizer completely breaks a lot of tests and
produces a lot of noise.

I'm not sure how we interpret Tested-by when deciding to merge; does it
mean someone is happy for the test to be merged or not?

Should someone add both tags if they have reviewed and tested it?
