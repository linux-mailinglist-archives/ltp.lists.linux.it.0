Agree, but we *do* have releases and do *not* have unstable branch.

Thus, first, do you agree with current policy?
If yes, how would you phrase it (do you want to add / change anything)?

Or do you suggest to have policy when merged to rc1?
It would work for me, but we'd have to ask all maintainers
(I suggested that before, Cyril preferred kernel release).

Kind regards,
Petr
