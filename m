Yes, I agree that they are different things.
But the lines are quite often rather blurry as most vfs changes have an
immediate impact on fs testing and testing them involves validating the
vfs interface and the fses implementing them.

I've mostly just described my ideal world where the two things would be
tightly coupled even during testing.
