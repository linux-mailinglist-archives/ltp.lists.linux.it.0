+Ground Rules
+============
+
+Do not work around kernel bugs
+------------------------------
+
+We have decided that we will not work around bugs in upstream LTP sources. If a
+test fails on your system for a good reason, e.g. patch wasn't backported and
+the bug is present, work around for this will not be accepted upstream. The
+main reason for this decision is that this masks the failure for everyone else.
+
+
+Do not synchronize by sleep
+---------------------------
+
+Why is sleep in tests bad then?
+```````````````````````````````
+
+The first problem is that it will likely introduce very rare test failures,
+that means somebody has to spend time looking into these, which is a wasted
+effort. Nobody likes tests that will fail rarely for no good reason. Even more
+so you cannot run such tests with a background load to ensure that everything
+works correctly on a busy system, because that will increase the likehood of a
+failure.
+
+The second problem is that this wastes resources and slows down a test run. If
+you think that adding a sleep to a test is not a big deal, lets have a look at
+the bigger perspective. There are about 1600 syscall tests in Linux Test
+Project, if 7.5% of them would sleep just for one second, we would end up with
+two minutes of wasted time per testrun. In practice most of the tests, that
+historically misused sleep for synchronization, waited for much longer just to
+be sure that things will works even on slower hardware. With sleeps between 2
+and 5 seconds that puts us somewhere between 4 and 10 minutes which is between
+13% and 33% of the syscall runtime on an outdated thinkpad, where the run
+finishes in a bit less than half an hour. It's even worse on newer hardware,
+because this slowdown will not change no matter how fast your machine is, which
+is maybe the reason why this was acceptable twenty years ago but it's not now.
+
+
+What to do instead?
+```````````````````
+
+Use proper synchronization.
+
+There are different problems and different solutions. Most often test needs to
+synchronize between child and parent process.
+
+The easiest case is when parent needs to wait for a child to finish, that can
+be fixed just be adding a :manpage:`waitpid(2)` in the parent which ensures that child
+has finished before parent runs.
+
+Commonly child has to execute certain piece of code before parent can continue.
+For that LTP library implements checkpoints with simple
+:c:func:`TST_CHECKPOINT_WAIT()` and :c:func:`TST_CHECKPOINT_WAKE()` functions based
+on futexes on a piece of shared memory set up by the test library.
+
+Another common case is when a child must sleep in a syscall before parent can
+continue, for which we have a :c:func:`TST_PROCESS_STATE_WAIT()` helper that
+polls `/proc/$PID/stat`.
+
+Less often test needs to wait for an action that is done asynchronously, or for
+a kernel resource deallocation that is deferred to a later time. In such cases
+the best we can do is to poll. In LTP we ended up with a macro that polls by
+calling a piece of code in a loop with exponentially increasing sleeps between
+retries until it succeeds. Which means that instead of sleeping for a maximal
+time event can possibly take the sleep is capped by twice of the optimal
+sleeping time while we avoid polling too aggressively.
+
+
+Use runtime checks for kernel features
+--------------------------------------
+
+What is and what isn't supported by kernel is determined by the version and
+configuration of the kernel the system is currently running on.  That
+especially means that any checks done during the compilation cannot be used to
+assume features supported by the kernel the tests end up running on. The
+compile time checks, done by :master:`configure.ac` script, are only useful for
+enabling fallback kernel API definitions when missing, as we do in
+:master:`include/lapi/` directory.
+
+
+Don’t require root unless it’s essential
+----------------------------------------
+
+If root/caps are needed, say why in the test doc comment. Drop privileges for
+the part that doesn’t need them and avoid running the whole test as root
+“because it’s easier”.
+
+
+Always clean up, even on failure
+--------------------------------
+
+Every test should leave the system as it found it: unmount, restore sysctls,
+delete temp files/dirs, kill spawned processes, remove cgroups/namespaces,
+detach loop devices, restore ulimits, etc. Cleanup must run on early-exit
+paths too.
+
+The test library can simplify cleanup greatly as there are various helpers such as:
+
+- :c:type:`tst_test.needs_tmpdir <tst_test>` that creates and deletes a temporary directory for the test
+- :c:type:`tst_test.save_restore <tst_test>` that saves and restores /sys/ and /proc/ files
+- :c:type:`tst_test.needs_device <tst_test>` sets up and tears down a block device for the test
+- :c:type:`tst_test.restore_wallclock <tst_test>` that restores wall clock after the test
+- :c:type:`tst_test.needs_cgroup_ctrls <tst_test>` sets up and cleans up cgroups for the test
+- ...
+
+
+Write portable code
+-------------------
+
+Avoid nonstandard libc APIs when a portable equivalent exists; don’t assume
+64-bit, page size, endianness, or particular tool versions.
+
+If the test is specific to a certain architecture, make sure that it at least
+compiles at the rest of architectures and set the
+:c:type:`tst_test.supported_archs <tst_test>`.
+
+This also applies to shell code where it's easy to use bash features that are
+not available on other shell implementations, e.g. dash or busybox. Make sure
+to stick to portable POSIX shell whenever possible.
+
+You can check for common mistakes, not only in portability, with our
+'make check' tooling.
+
+
+Split changed into well defined chunks
+--------------------------------------
+
+When submitting patches make sure to split the work into small well-defined
+chunks. Patches that touch many files or mix unrelated changes and features are
+difficuilt to review and are likely to be detalyed or even ignored.
+
+Aim for a single logical change per patch. Split more complex works into a
+patch series where each patch:
+
+  - builds/compiles successfully.
+  - keeps tests and tooling functional.
+  - does not introduce intermediate breakage.
+  - has a clear commit message to explain the change.
+  - Significant changes need to be detailed in the cover letter.
+
+
+Be careful when using AI tools
+------------------------------
+
+AI tools can be useful for executing, summarizing, or suggesting approaches,
+but they can also be confidently wrong and give an illusion of correctness.
+Treat AI output as untrusted: verify claims against the code, documentation,
+and actual behavior on a reproducer.
+
+Do not send AI-generated changes as raw patches. AI-generated diffs often
+contain irrelevant churn, incorrect assumptions, inconsistent style, or subtle
+bugs, which creates additional burden for maintainers to review and fix.
+
+Best practice is to write your own patches and have them reviewed by AI before
+submitting them, which helps add beneficial improvements to your work.
+
+
+Kernel features and RCs
+-----------------------
+
+LTP tests or fixes for kernel changes that have not yet been released may be
+posted to the LTP list for a review but they will not be be accepted until
+respective kernel changes are released. Review of such changes is also
+considered to be lower priority than rest of the changes. This is because
+kernel changes especially in the early RC phase are volatile and could be
+changed or reverted.
+
+These patchses should also add a [STAGING] keyword into the patch subject, e.g.
+"Subject: [PATCH v1][STAGING] fanotify: add test for <feature> (requires v6.19-rc3)"
+
+In a case that a test for unrelased kernel is really needed to be merged we do
+not add it to the list of test executed by default and keep it in
+:master:`runtest/staging` file until the kernel code is finalized.
