+1 this is very necessary IMO

Actually we can use the C API. This would avoid a whole bunch of
issues. It requires creating a utility which we can use from shell
(e.g. tst_cgctl).

We *may* have to track state somehow. Either we could run the utility as
a daemon initially and communicate with a socket to execute commands. Or
we could save/serialise some state to environment/shell
variables. Alternatively we can probably rescan the system each
time. The only state really required is the test's PID which is needed
to find the correct CGroup in the LTP sub-hierarchy.

Still that is probably easier than dealing with all of the corner cases
twice.

There are still controllers/features that don't exist on V2. Meanwhile
there are features that only exist on V2. So if someone wants both, then
they have to mount both. Regardless, this was the default in systemd, so
we are stuck with it for about 20 years and can't ignore it ;-)

Yes, or if it is a utility then

$ test_cpu_cg_dir = $(tst_cgroup require cpu)
$ test_cpu_cg_dir = $(tst_cgroup require memory)

maybe with an option to pass the PID to indetify the test. I guess there
might be some existing env variable the shell API sets we could use as well.

$ tst_cgroup cleanup --pid $MAIN_PID
