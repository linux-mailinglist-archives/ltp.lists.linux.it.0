I don't think it's possible. One it's meant to be github pages while 
readthedocs is hosted somewhere else in https://readthedocs.org/

As far as I know, both github and gitlab support RST and the idea is to 
rewrite README as well, because it contains multiple errors and it will 
be replaced by index.rst

Yes, we will use Doxygen. It will come in a second phase, after 
refactoring the whole documentation into RST.

I also forgot to mention that Sphinx is highly customizable due to the 
python scripting, so we can generate static pages at build time, 
introducing (for example) versions release letters and many other things.
