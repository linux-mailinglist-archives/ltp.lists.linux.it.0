Obviously you do that to your local git tree. This is basics of git
development nothing specific to LTP here.

Isn't that the same? If you know what are developers doing in order to
catch common mistakes you can as well avoid doing them...

I think that there are different levels of newcommers. I do not think
that the documment is supposed to help newcommers that are already
familiar with how git based development works and only highlights
things that are specific to LTP.
