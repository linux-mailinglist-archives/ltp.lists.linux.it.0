> +noble goal it's not the universal holy grail of testing. Different use cases
> +have different considerations and scope. For a testing before a final release
> +such testing is very desirable, however for a continuous integration or smoke
> +testing the main requirement is that feedback loops are as short as possible.
> +
> +When a developer changes the kernel and submits the changes to be merged it's
> +desirable to run some tests. Again the hard question is which tests. If we run
> +all possible tests in all possible combinations it may take a day or two and
> +the developer will move to a different tasks before the tests have a chance to
> +finish. If you multiply that by a number of developers in the team you may end
> +up in a situation where a developer will retire before tests for his patch may
> +have had a chance to finish.
> +
> +In this case careful selection of tests is even more important. Having less is
> +more in this context. One of the first ideas for CI is to skip tests that run
> +for more than a second or so, happily this can be easily done with `kirk
> +<https://github.com/linux-test-project/kirk/>`_. In the future we may want to
> +explore some heuristics that would map the code changes in kernel into a subset
> +of tests, which would allow for a very quick feedback.
> +
> +
> +Debugging test failures
> +-----------------------
> +
> +You may think that you will enjoy some rest once you have your test matrix
> +ready and your tests are running. Unfortunately that's where the actual work
> +starts. Debugging test failures is probably the hardest part of the testing
> +process. In some cases failures are easily reproducible and it's not that hard
> +to locate the bug, either in the test or in the kernel itself. There are
> +however, quite common, cases where the test failure reproduces only in 10% or
> +even 1% of the test runs. Sometimes tests are not failing in isolation, that is
> +because operating system has a huge internal state and a test failure manifests
> +only after running right sequence of tests. All of that does not mean that
> +there is no bug, that usually means that the bug depends on more prerequisites
> +that have to manifest at the right time in order to trigger the failure. Sadly
> +for modern systems that are asynchronous in nature such bugs are more and more
> +common.
> +
> +The debugging process itself is not complicated by its nature. You have to
> +attempt to understand the failure by checking the logs, reading and
> +understanding the source code, debugging with strace, gdb, etc. Then form a
> +hypothesis and either prove or disprove it. Rinse and repeat until you end up
> +with a clear description of what went wrong. Hopefully you will manage to find
> +the root cause, but you should not be discouraged, if you do not. Debugging
> +kernel bugs takes a lot of experience and skill one can say as much as is
> +needed to write the kernel code.
> +
