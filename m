Hi!

In general I like the idea, but many sentences can be shorten. I didn't
use AI for this review, but usually they work pretty well on spotting
errors and english mistakes and it might be a good idea to review it
first with that.

Some comments below.

Less often, tests need to wait for an action that is done asynchronously
or they need to wait for a kernel resource deallocation. In such cases,
the best we can do is using polling mechanism. In LTP we have a macro
that loops over a piece of code, exponentially increasing sleeps between
retries until succeed.

 -> it would be nice to add the link to it.

For the entire section I would put a bullet points list.

Supported kernel features are determined by version and configuration
of the kernel running on the system.

This means that kernel features can't be always checked at compile-time.
Please keep compile-time checks only for fallback kernel API definitions,
when needed. -> (reference to lapi?)

LTP tests for new kernel features inside the mainline can be sent to the
mailing list, but they will get a low priority in the review process due
to the highly volatile nature of Linux kernel before release.
