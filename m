Possibly it is in scope; 32bit makes a lot of sense on small cloud
VMs. It's also possible for ppc64 IIRC.

The only reason I mentioned x86 is because IIRC the flag is different on
some arches. These are just examples, but I could change the wording to
make it less specific?

I didn't remove it because I am not sure if the "new tests" section is a
list of demands. Whereas these are just suggestions.

I use it a lot. I don't remember having to enable anything, it seemed to
just work.

It provides a huge benefit I would say.
