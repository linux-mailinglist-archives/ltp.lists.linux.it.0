Hi Richie,

> I see two options for patch review. Either we have a single senior
> maintainer who does most of or it is distributed.

> For now I think it needs to be distributed which is beyond the scope
> of this commit.

> In order to distribute it we need new contributors to review each
> others' work at least for the first few revisions.

> I think that anyone can review a patch if they put the work in to test
> it and try to break it. Then understand why it is broken.

> This commit states some ideas about how to do that, plus some tips for
> more advanced patch review.

Very nice improvements, thanks!
I agree with points Cyril already raised.

I'd rename the page to patch-review.txt (can be done later).

very nit: you sometimes put dot at the end of list item, sometimes not.

BTW: I suppose nobody bothers about 32bit arm or even other archs.
It's definitely out of scope in SUSE.

Very nice list, which show how hard would be to do a proper testing
(not being run for most of the patches - it's found afterwards, but it's very
good you list it there).

> +* Run reproducers on a kernel where the bug is present
> +* Run tests with "-i0"
`-i0` (for better syntax).

I'd also mention -i100 (or even higher, e.g. -i1100 to catch errors like get
file descriptors exhausted due missing SAFE_CLOSE(fd)).

Also, both of these are already somehow mentioned at "New tests" section, I'd
remove it from there (enough to mention them just once).

Again, very good points, even it's hard to test all of these before.

I'd encourage people to enable GitHub Actions in their forks (I'm not sure how
many maintainers do this; best would be automation [1] [2], but nobody bothers
about CI and I'm sort of burn out driving it myself).

Kind regards,
Petr
