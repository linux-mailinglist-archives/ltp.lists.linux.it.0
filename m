I could do part of work as well. I volunteer to upload the tarballs.
I also try to help with reviewing and testing pre release fixes.
I usually do network tests changelog, which is tiny part of whole changelog.

I try to do at least some of runtime tests on SLES and Tumbleweed, I suppose
Martin helps with it as usually. Obviously more people should do pre-release
testing.

And in my non work time build testing on Buildroot (finds various build problems
on other libc and generally the embedded world).

Yes, it's still in WIP.  I'll finish the "Track minimal size per filesystem"
patchset after merging $TST_ALL_FILESYSTEMS.

I'd really prefer to get reviewed and merged "v5 shell: df01.sh:
$TST_ALL_FILESYSTEMS (.all_filesystems)" [1] [2]. Martin has suggested for v4 to
use 2 different enums (TST_FS_UNAVAILABLE and TST_FS_UNSUPPORTED instead of
TST_FS_UNSUPPORTED) [3]. I'm willing to implement that in Monday if are others
ok and hope this is the last change and whole thing can be merged.

I don't mind to merge "Fix mkfs.xfs 300MB min size requirement (v5.19.0)" [4]
[5] as a temporary fix before release.

Kind regards,
Petr
