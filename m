They will be in /nix/store/<kernel package hash>/.../modules or similar.
I can probably make it work on NixOS by creating a nix file, but I think
there is a bigger issue.

IMO it should only be best efforts. If the system doesn't have these
files or modprobe, or it is running in a sandbox, then we should just
try to run the test. In the worst case it fails with TBROK, but we won't
block testing unecessarily.

If the test doesn't require any unecessary privileges or resources then
it can be used to see if a bug is reachable from a container or on some
embedded system.

I suppose that it could fail by default and the checks could be disabled
with an env var.
