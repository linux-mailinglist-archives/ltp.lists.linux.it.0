Thanks for explaining that.  I had assumed that the the file was always
visible from all name spaces, but before the fix every namespace saw the
same file.  Clearly I was wrong.

I think there are two totally separate questions here.
1/ How to fix the existing test to work on new and old kernels.  The
  existing test checked that the rpc count increased when NFS traffic
  happened.  I think 1 is the correct fix.  I don't think the test
  should check kernel version.

2/ We have discovered a bug and want to add a test to guard against
  regression.  This should be a new test.  That test can simply check if
  the given file exist in a non-init namespace.  I have no particular
  opinion about testing kernel versions.  A credible approach would be
  to choose the oldest kernel which it still maintained at the time that
  that bug was discovered.  Or maybe create a list of kernel versions
  where were maintained at that time and only run the test on versions
  in that list, or after the last in the list.

I really think there is value in having two different tests because we
are testing two different things.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
