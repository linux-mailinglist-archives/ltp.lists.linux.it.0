I do not think that there will be a big differences though, the only
difference would be that we would get proper types, i.e. strings vs
integers. The rest of the processing we do filters out fields we are not
interested in, or checks if implied flags are not defined, etc. that is
going to stay regardless.

I've send a v2 for the patchset. I still think that we should merge
that in order to get usable metadata now so that we can finally
implement/fix several issues, namely:

https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/issues/868

Here we really need the metadata available and loaded in the testrunner
so that we know that reboot is comming. This one can be implemented only
with the last patch of the series that installs the json metadata
unconditionally.


https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/issues/824

This one is more complicated though, also the mmap1 is not the only test
that suffers from this condition, there is at least writev03 that
suffers from timeouts.

In order to compute the test runtime properly we need to know the upper
limit for the test iterations, which is currently multiplication of
.test_variants and supported filesystems if .all_filesystems is set,
which is the main motivation behing pushing this patchset forward along
with the runtime patchset. Once these two are merged, the test runtime
and safe enough timeout can be easily computed from the test metadata
and used by the testrunners.
