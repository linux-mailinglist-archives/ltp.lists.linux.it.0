Naresh Kamboju reported [1]  5.4 mainline LTS kernels are failing on fanotify14,
exactly the same way Martin reported on SLES kernel based 5.3.18 (+ tons of
backported patches). Linaro did not mention this before, because they tested 5.4
on older LTP.

@Amir, Isn't this a reason to either accept these 2 Martin's patches or bring
another approach which fixes the detection in fanotify_init() ?

Kind regards,
Petr
