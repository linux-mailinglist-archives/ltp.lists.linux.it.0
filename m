Good catch, yes, conf/default/disable_ipv6 is inherited, thus
mandatory for check altogether with conf/${IFACE}/disable_ipv6 
(for ${LHOST_IFACES:-} and ${RHOST_IFACES:-} - ssh).
We can ignore conf/all/disable_ipv6 [1]:

	Reading this value does not have any particular meaning. It does not say
	whether IPv6 support is enabled or disabled. Returned value can be 1 also in
	the case when some interface has disable_ipv6 set to 0 and has configured
	IPv6 addresses.

I'd add this check before calling init_ltp_netspace(). That expects:
1) nobody changes this setup (one day we may want to test this functionality,
thus even LTP itself can change this setup) 2) any NIC without IPv6 means no
IPv6 testing, right?

BTW at least network tests which use virt_lib.sh requires IPv6 for IPv4 tests.
ip6_virt_remote="$(TST_IPV6=6 tst_ipaddr_un rhost)"
which is then used in virt_setup():

# ./macsec02.sh
macsec02 1 TINFO: setup IPsec transport/esp_aead des3_ede
macsec02 1 TINFO: setup local macsec with 'icvlen 16 encodingsa 0 replay on window 300 encrypt on protect on'
macsec02 1 TINFO: setup rhost macsec with 'icvlen 16 encodingsa 0 replay on window 300 encrypt on protect on'
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
macsec02 1 TBROK: ip addr add ::2/64 dev ltp_v0 nodad failed

# ./vlan03.sh
RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
vlan03 1 TBROK: ip addr add ::2/64 dev ltp_v0 nodad failed

These tests would have to be either split to IPv4 (default) and IPv6 (-6)
or entirely depend on IPv6 (obviously first is better, but more work).

Kind regards,
Petr
