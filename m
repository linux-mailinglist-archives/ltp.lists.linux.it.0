Hi!

My 2 cents below.

No, but it provides something better than that: a JSON file that can be 
easily parsed by most of the libraries out there.
kirk can be literally used as it is runltp, with difference of python 
dependency. If you have python, you can run kirk on
host as well as on target. All features like Qemu, LTX, SSH (etc.) 
supports are meant to be used by host only.
