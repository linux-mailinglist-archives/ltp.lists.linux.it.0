Isn't "... because it can be reverted in later rc if problematic" enough?
If not what would you add? Cyril posted test getting released in LTP and later
unstable. I could be more verbose, but not sure if that's better:

* Tests for new functionality in mainline kernel should be merged after final
  release of kernel which contains that functionality. It's not enough when the
  feature gets into rc1, because in later rc the functionality can be changed or
  even reverted if problematic. And this could lead to broken test.

Kind regards,
Petr
