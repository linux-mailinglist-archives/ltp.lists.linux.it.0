Yes that's it. Since we decided to skip arches depending on what is
tst_test instead of compiling out the whole test. Which we want to do
because it provides meta-data.

I guess we could define the macro as ts_brk(TCONF, ...). However another
problem I just thought of is that cpuid.h might exist on a non-x86
system. So we'll still get a compilation failure.

Ideally we want compilation to fail even on x86 if the correct guards
are not in place and we include cpuid.h.

So we could use some macros like TST_ARCH_GUARD_X86 which is defined by
TST_IF_X86 and undefined by TST_ELSE_X86/TST_ENDIF_X86. Then cpuid.h can
check for that macro.

We could also define assembly in TST_ASM_X86 etc., although it's more
obvious that won't compile on non x86.

Alternatively I could try doing something in Sparse, but the macro pass
is maybe not as easy to hook into.
